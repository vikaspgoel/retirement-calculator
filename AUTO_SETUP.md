# What Happens After You Install Node.js

Once you've installed Node.js and restarted your computer, I will automatically:

1. ✅ Install all required packages (this takes 2-3 minutes)
2. ✅ Create the environment configuration file
3. ✅ Start the development server
4. ✅ Give you the link to open in your browser

**You don't need to do anything else!** Just install Node.js, restart, and let me know. I'll handle the rest.

## Quick Reference

**After restarting, just say:**
- "Done" or
- "I've installed Node.js" or  
- "Ready to continue"

And I'll take over from there! 🚀
