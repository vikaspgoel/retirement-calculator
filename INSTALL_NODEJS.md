# How to Install Node.js (Simple Steps)

Since you don't have Node.js installed, please follow these simple steps:

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Download Node.js
1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
2. Go to this website: **https://nodejs.org/**
3. You'll see a big green button that says "Download Node.js (LTS)"
4. Click that button - it will automatically download the right version for Windows

### Step 2: Install Node.js
1. Go to your Downloads folder (usually in File Explorer)
2. Find the file you just downloaded (it will be named something like `node-v20.x.x-x64.msi`)
3. Double-click on it to run the installer
4. Click "Next" on all the screens (you can accept all the default options)
5. When it asks for Administrator password, click "Yes" or enter your password
6. Wait for it to finish installing (this takes 1-2 minutes)
7. Click "Finish" when done

### Step 3: Restart Your Computer
- Close all programs
- Restart your computer (this is important so the system recognizes Node.js)
