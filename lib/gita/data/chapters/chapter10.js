  // The origin of all

    verse: 2,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'न मे विदुः सुरगणाः प्रभवं न महर्षयः |\nअहमादिर्हि देवानां महर्षीणां च सर्वशः ||',
    transliteration: 'na me viduḥ sura-gaṇāḥ prabhavaṁ na maharṣayaḥ\naham ādir hi devānāṁ maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ',
    translation: 'Neither the hosts of gods nor the great sages know My origin, for I am the source of all the gods and great sages in every way.',
    commentary: `Krishna's origin is unknown even to gods and sages because He is their source. They cannot comprehend what precedes them; the effect cannot fully know the cause. Krishna is ādi—the beginning of all beginnings.

Shankaracharya notes that this establishes Krishna's ultimacy. Even the highest beings in the cosmic hierarchy derive from Him and therefore cannot completely know Him. Only by His grace can He be known.

This humbles intellectual arrogance. If gods and sages cannot comprehend Krishna through their own power, human speculation is even more limited. Knowledge of the Divine comes through revelation and grace, not through independent analysis.`

  // Knowing Krishna frees from sin

    verse: 3,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'hope'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'यो मामजमनादिं च वेत्ति लोकमहेश्वरम् |\nअसम्मूढः स मर्त्येषु सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'yo mām ajam anādiṁ ca vetti loka-maheśvaram\nasammūḍhaḥ sa martyeṣu sarva-pāpaiḥ pramucyate',
    translation: 'One who knows Me as unborn, beginningless, and the great Lord of worlds—that undeluded one among mortals is freed from all sins.',
    commentary: `Knowing Krishna truly—as unborn (aja), beginningless (anādi), and Lord of worlds (loka-maheśvara)—liberates from all sins. Such knowledge makes one "undeluded" (asammūḍha) among mortals.

"Unborn and beginningless" indicates Krishna's transcendence of time. Everything else has a beginning; He does not. This is not an attribute added to a being but the nature of absolute reality.

The liberation from sin is not magical forgiveness but the natural result of true knowledge. When one sees Krishna as the ultimate Lord, the ignorance that produces sin dissolves. The root cut, the branches wither.`

  // All qualities come from Krishna

    id: 'bg-10-4',
    chapter: 10,
    verse: 4,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'बुद्धिर्ज्ञानमसम्मोहः क्षमा सत्यं दमः शमः |\nसुखं दुःखं भवोऽभावो भयं चाभयमेव च ||',
    transliteration: 'buddhir jñānam asammohaḥ kṣamā satyaṁ damaḥ śamaḥ\nsukhaṁ duḥkhaṁ bhavo\'bhāvo bhayaṁ cābhayam eva ca',
    translation: 'Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from delusion, forgiveness, truth, self-control, calmness, happiness, pain, birth, death, fear, and fearlessness...',
    commentary: `Krishna lists qualities that come from Him: intelligence (buddhi), knowledge (jñāna), non-delusion (asammoha), forgiveness (kṣamā), truth (satya), self-control (dama), calmness (śama), and pairs of opposites—happiness/pain, birth/death, fear/fearlessness.

This list includes both "positive" and "negative" qualities. Even pain and fear are from Krishna. This prevents a dualistic view where good is from God and evil is from elsewhere. All experience, all qualities, all states derive from the One.

Seeing all qualities as divine manifestations transforms perception. Intelligence in a scientist is Krishna; forgiveness in a saint is Krishna; even the fear that motivates caution is Krishna. Everything points back to source.`

  // I am the source of all

    id: 'bg-10-8',
    chapter: 10,
    verse: 8,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'surrender'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'अहं सर्वस्य प्रभवो मत्तः सर्वं प्रवर्तते |\nइति मत्वा भजन्ते मां बुधा भावसमन्विताः ||',
    transliteration: 'ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate\niti matvā bhajante māṁ budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ',
    translation: 'I am the source of all; from Me everything proceeds. Knowing this, the wise worship Me, endowed with loving emotion.',
    commentary: `The central declaration: "I am the source of all; from Me everything proceeds." The wise who know this worship Krishna with bhāva—loving emotion, genuine feeling, not mere ritual.

Shankaracharya explains that "everything proceeds" includes not only creation but all activity, all knowledge, all existence. Nothing happens apart from Krishna; nothing exists independently.

"Endowed with loving emotion" (bhāva-samanvitāḥ) distinguishes true worship from mechanical observance. The wise don't just intellectually accept; they feel the truth. This emotional component makes worship alive, personal, transformative.`

  // Mutual love between Krishna and devotees
  {
    id: 'bg-10-9',
    chapter: 10,
    verse: 9,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['peace', 'faith'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'मच्चित्ता मद्गतप्राणा बोधयन्तः परस्परम् |\nकथयन्तश्च मां नित्यं तुष्यन्ति च रमन्ति च ||',
    transliteration: 'mac-cittā mad-gata-prāṇā bodhayantaḥ parasparam\nkathayantaś ca māṁ nityaṁ tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca',
    translation: 'With minds fixed on Me, lives surrendered to Me, enlightening one another and always speaking of Me, they are content and rejoice.',
    commentary: `The life of devotees: minds on Krishna (mac-cittā), lives surrendered (mad-gata-prāṇā), mutually encouraging (bodhayantaḥ parasparam), always discussing Krishna (kathayantaś ca māṁ), content (tuṣyanti), and rejoicing (ramanti).

This describes sangha—spiritual community. Devotees don't practice in isolation but support each other through shared contemplation and conversation. "Always speaking of Me" suggests that Krishna is the constant topic, the common love.

"Content and rejoice" indicates the emotional fruit. Devotion is not grimly serious but joyful. The devotees are satisfied; they enjoy their spiritual life. This counters the misconception that spirituality means grim renunciation.`

  // To those devoted, Krishna gives understanding

    themes: ['faith', 'knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'तेषां सततयुक्तानां भजतां प्रीतिपूर्वकम् |\nददामि बुद्धियोगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते ||',
    transliteration: 'teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam\ndadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te',
    translation: 'To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give that yoga of understanding by which they come to Me.',
    commentary: `The promise of grace: to those constantly devoted (satata-yuktānām) who worship with love (prīti-pūrvakam), Krishna gives buddhi-yoga—the understanding by which they reach Him. Effort meets grace; devotion is rewarded with insight.

"I give" (dadāmi) indicates divine initiative. The devotee practices; Krishna responds by granting understanding. This is not self-effort alone but cooperative relationship. Human striving opens the door; divine grace walks through.

This explains why some seekers "get it" while others struggle despite effort. The missing factor is often love (prīti). Intellectual pursuit without heart doesn't evoke the grace that intellectual pursuit with love receives.`

  // Arjuna's response
  {
    id: 'bg-10-12',
    chapter: 10,
    verse: 12,
    narrativeRole: 'ARJUNA_STATE',
    quadrants: ['Q3'],
    themes: ['faith', 'courage'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'अर्जुन उवाच |\nपरं ब्रह्म परं धाम पवित्रं परमं भवान् |\nपुरुषं शाश्वतं दिव्यमादिदेवमजं विभुम् ||',
    transliteration: 'arjuna uvāca\nparaṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān\npuruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum',
    translation: 'Arjuna said: You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme abode, the supreme purifier, the eternal divine Person, the primal God, unborn and all-pervading.',
    commentary: `Arjuna's declaration of faith: Krishna is supreme Brahman (paraṁ brahma), supreme abode (paraṁ dhāma), supreme purifier (pavitraṁ paramam), eternal Person (puruṣaṁ śāśvatam), divine (divyam), primal God (ādi-devam), unborn (ajam), all-pervading (vibhum).

This is not flattery but recognition. Arjuna has heard Krishna's teachings and now affirms their truth. The disciple's response validates the teacher's revelation.

"Unborn and all-pervading" captures the paradox of Krishna: transcendent (unborn—beyond the world) and immanent (all-pervading—within everything). Both are true; neither alone is complete. Arjuna has understood.`

  // Arjuna requests to hear Krishna's glories

    verse: 18,
    narrativeRole: 'ARJUNA_STATE',
    quadrants: ['Q3'],
    themes: ['faith'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'विस्तरेणात्मनो योगं विभूतिं च जनार्दन |\nभूयः कथय तृप्तिर्हि शृण्वतो नास्ति मेऽमृतम् ||',
    transliteration: 'vistareṇātmano yogaṁ vibhūtiṁ ca janārdana\nbhūyaḥ kathaya tṛptir hi śṛṇvato nāsti me\'mṛtam',
    translation: 'Tell me again in detail of Your yoga-power and glory, O Janardana. For I am never satiated hearing Your nectar-like words.',
    commentary: `Arjuna asks to hear more—he's not satiated (tṛptir nāsti) hearing Krishna's "nectar-like words" (amṛtam). This is spiritual hunger, not curiosity. The more he hears, the more he wants.

This request prompts the famous vibhūti section where Krishna lists His divine manifestations. Arjuna's eagerness opens the teaching; his love draws out Krishna's revelation.

The image of "nectar" (amṛta) for Krishna's words indicates their life-giving quality. Ordinary words inform; divine words transform. Arjuna experiences this and wants more. This is the sign of genuine spiritual appetite.`

  // Krishna begins listing His manifestations
  {
    id: 'bg-10-20',
    chapter: 10,
    verse: 20,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थितः |\nअहमादिश्च मध्यं च भूतानामन्त एव च ||',
    transliteration: 'aham ātmā guḍākeśa sarva-bhūtāśaya-sthitaḥ\naham ādiś ca madhyaṁ ca bhūtānām anta eva ca',
    translation: 'I am the Self, O Gudakesha, seated in the hearts of all beings. I am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all beings.',
    commentary: `Krishna begins: "I am the Self (ātmā) seated in the hearts of all beings." This is the foundation—before any external manifestation, Krishna is the innermost Self of every being. Then He adds: beginning, middle, and end of all.

"Seated in the hearts" (āśaya-sthita) indicates intimate presence. Krishna is not distant but the very core of each being's existence. The search for God ends in one's own heart where God has always resided.

"Beginning, middle, and end" covers the entire temporal span. Nothing exists outside this range; Krishna encompasses all phases of existence. This is the cosmic dimension of the same presence that dwells in hearts.`

  // Excellence everywhere is Krishna

    verse: 41,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'यद्यद्विभूतिमत्सत्त्वं श्रीमदूर्जितमेव वा |\nतत्तदेवावगच्छ त्वं मम तेजोंऽशसम्भवम् ||',
    transliteration: 'yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ śrīmad ūrjitam eva vā\ntat tad evāvagaccha tvaṁ mama tejo\'ṁśa-sambhavam',
    translation: 'Whatever being has glory, prosperity, or power—know that to have sprung from a fraction of My splendor.',
    commentary: `The universal principle: wherever there is glory (vibhūti), prosperity (śrī), or power (ūrjita), know that as arising from a fraction (aṁśa) of Krishna's splendor (tejas). Every excellence points to Him.

This teaching enables seeing Krishna everywhere. The beauty of a sunset, the genius of a scientist, the courage of a hero—all are fragments of divine glory. The world becomes a gallery of Krishna's manifestations.

"A fraction of My splendor" indicates that even the totality of worldly excellence is only a tiny part of Krishna's infinite glory. What we see is impressive; what remains unseen is infinitely more so.`

    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'अथवा बहुनैतेन किं ज्ञातेन तवार्जुन |\nविष्टभ्याहमिदं कृत्स्नमेकांशेन स्थितो जगत् ||',
    transliteration: 'atha vā bahunaitena kiṁ jñātena tavārjuna\nviṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam ekāṁśena sthito jagat',
    translation: 'But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? I support this entire universe with just a single fragment of Myself.',
    commentary: `The chapter's climax: why list particulars? With a single fragment (ekāṁśena), Krishna supports the entire universe (kṛtsnam jagat). All the previous lists are just examples; the truth is simpler and more vast.

Shankaracharya sees this as the ultimate statement of divine power. The whole cosmos, in all its complexity, is sustained by a mere portion of Krishna. The unmanifest remainder is infinitely greater.

This humbles all conceptualization. We can list Krishna's glories endlessly and not exhaust them. Better to simply know: He is everything, sustaining everything, with infinite reserve beyond what manifests. This is enough.`
