    translation: 'The Lord said: They speak of an imperishable Ashvattha tree with roots above and branches below, whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree knows the Vedas.',
    commentary: `Krishna begins with a powerful metaphor: the cosmic Ashvattha (sacred fig) tree with roots above (in Brahman) and branches below (in manifestation). The leaves are Vedic hymns—knowledge that sustains the tree. To know this tree is to know the Vedas' essence.

Shankaracharya explains that "roots above" indicates the source is transcendent—Brahman, the Supreme. The downward branches are the unfolding of manifestation. This inverted tree represents samsara: it appears substantial but is rooted in what is beyond appearance.

The Ashvattha is specifically chosen: it is a tree that appears permanent but is actually "a-shvattha" (not stable, not lasting). The world seems solid but is temporary. One who sees this truth—that manifestation is rooted in the transcendent and is itself impermanent—knows the essence of scripture.`

    transliteration: 'adhaś cordhvaṁ prasṛtās tasya śākhā guṇa-pravṛddhā viṣaya-pravālāḥ\nadhaś ca mūlāny anusantatāni karmānubandhīni manuṣya-loke',
    translation: 'Below and above spread its branches, nourished by the gunas, with sense objects as buds. Below also are stretched its roots, bound to action in the human world.',
    commentary: `The tree elaborates: branches spread in all directions (all realms of existence), nourished by gunas (the three qualities), producing sense objects as buds (the alluring growths). Secondary roots extend downward into the human world, binding through karma.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this describes how we get trapped. The gunas feed the tree's growth, making it appear more real and extensive. Sense objects bud forth, attracting attention and desire. Meanwhile, karma creates secondary roots—our actions bind us more deeply to the tree.

The human world (manuṣya-loke) is specifically mentioned as where karmic roots bind. This is because humans have the unique capacity for volitional action that creates karma. Animals act from instinct, gods enjoy past merit, but humans create new bonds through choice. This is both the trap and the opportunity.`

    transliteration: 'na rūpam asyeha tathopalabhyate nānto na cādir na ca sampratiṣṭhā\naśvattham enaṁ su-virūḍha-mūlam asaṅga-śastreṇa dṛḍhena chittvā',
    translation: 'Its form is not perceived here as such, nor its end, nor beginning, nor foundation. Having cut this firmly rooted Ashvattha tree with the strong axe of non-attachment...',
    commentary: `The tree's true form is not perceived in ordinary experience; its end, beginning, and foundation are hidden. Yet it must be cut—and the axe is non-attachment (asanga-shastra). This "firm" (dṛḍhena) weapon severs the deeply rooted tree.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that the tree cannot be understood while inside it. Only from beyond can one see its illusory nature. But to get beyond, one must cut it—and the only tool that works is non-attachment: releasing the grip that binds us to the tree.

"Strong axe of non-attachment" is a vivid image. Attachment is what feeds the tree from our side; non-attachment starves it. As we release our grip on sense objects, results, and identity, the tree loses its power over us. This is not suppression but understanding—seeing the tree for what it is.`

    transliteration: 'tataḥ padaṁ tat parimārgitavyaṁ yasmin gatā na nivartanti bhūyaḥ\ntam eva cādyaṁ puruṣaṁ prapadye yataḥ pravṛttiḥ prasṛtā purāṇī',
    translation: '...then that goal must be sought, reaching which they return not again, (thinking) "I take refuge in that primeval Person from whom has streamed forth this ancient activity."',
    commentary: `After cutting the tree, seek that state (padam) from which there is no return. This is done through surrender: "I take refuge in that primeval Person" (tam eva cādyam puruṣam prapadye). From Him the ancient stream of activity began; in Him it finds its rest.

From the Advaitic view, "no return" (na nivartanti bhūyaḥ) means liberation from the cycle of samsara. The one who reaches this state has transcended the tree entirely. What remains is not another state within the tree but freedom from the tree itself.

The combination is significant: first non-attachment (cutting the tree), then surrender (taking refuge). Non-attachment clears the way; surrender completes the journey. The final step is not self-effort but self-offering—recognizing the primeval Person as source and returning to Him.`

  // Who reaches the Supreme

    transliteration: 'nirmāna-mohā jita-saṅga-doṣā adhyātma-nityā vinivṛtta-kāmāḥ\ndvandvair vimuktāḥ sukha-duḥkha-saṁjñair gacchanty amūḍhāḥ padam avyayaṁ tat',
    translation: 'Free from pride and delusion, victorious over the evil of attachment, ever devoted to the Self, with desires completely turned away, liberated from the pairs called pleasure and pain—the undeluded reach that imperishable goal.',
    commentary: `Who reaches the eternal goal? Those free from pride and delusion (nirmāna-mohāḥ), who have conquered attachment (jita-saṅga-doṣāḥ), are devoted to Self-knowledge (adhyātma-nityāḥ), have turned from desire (vinivṛtta-kāmāḥ), are released from pleasure-pain duality (dvandvair vimuktāḥ), and are undeluded (amūḍhāḥ).

Shankaracharya notes that this describes the state after cutting the tree. Pride is gone (nirmāna) because the false self that was proud is seen through. Delusion is gone (moha) because the tree is recognized as temporary. Attachment is conquered because non-attachment was the axe.

"Devoted to the Self" (adhyātma-nityāḥ) indicates where attention rests after liberation from the tree. Not scattered among branches and buds but gathered in the unchanging root above. This is not effort but natural orientation once the distractions are cut away.`

    transliteration: 'na tad bhāsayate sūryo na śaśāṅko na pāvakaḥ\nyad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama',
    translation: 'The sun does not illuminate that, nor the moon, nor fire. Having gone there, they return not. That is My supreme abode.',
    commentary: `The supreme abode (dhāma paramam) is beyond natural light—sun, moon, and fire cannot reach it. It is self-luminous, needing no external illumination. From there, none returns. This is Krishna's eternal realm.

From the Advaitic view, this describes the Self (Ātman) or Brahman. The Self is not illumined by anything else; it is pure consciousness, the light by which all other lights are seen. Sun and moon reveal objects; the Self reveals sun and moon.

"My supreme abode" (mama dhāma paramam) personalizes the absolute. This is not abstract Brahman but Krishna's dwelling—the divine realm where the Lord and His devotees abide eternally. The impersonal and personal are not opposed; the supreme abode is both beyond description and intimate with the Divine.`

    transliteration: 'mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ\nmanaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati',
    translation: 'An eternal fragment of Myself, having become a living being in the world of life, draws to itself the senses with the mind as the sixth, which abide in prakriti.',
    commentary: `A crucial revelation: the individual soul (jīva) is an "eternal fragment" (sanātanaḥ aṁśaḥ) of Krishna. Not created, not separate in essence, but a portion of the Divine that has entered the world and gathered around itself a mind and senses from prakriti.

Shankaracharya interprets "fragment" (aṁśa) carefully: it does not mean the infinite is divided. Rather, like space in a pot appears separate from total space while remaining continuous, the jīva appears individual while being non-different from Brahman.

"Draws to itself" (karṣati) suggests the active role of the jīva in acquiring the apparatus of experience. Mind and senses don't just happen; they are attracted and held. This hints that liberation involves releasing what was drawn, not destroying what was inherently present.`

    transliteration: 'śarīraṁ yad avāpnoti yac cāpy utkrāmatīśvaraḥ\ngṛhītvaitāni saṁyāti vāyur gandhān ivāśayāt',
    translation: 'When the lord (of the body) acquires a body, and when it leaves, it takes these (mind and senses) and goes, as the wind carries fragrances from their source.',
    commentary: `The jīva is called "lord" (īśvara) of the body—it presides over this body-mind complex. At death, it departs with mind and senses, moving to the next body like wind carrying fragrances. The body dies; the subtle apparatus transmigrates.

From the traditional view, this explains reincarnation. The physical body is discarded, but the subtle body (mind, senses, accumulated karma) continues. The jīva enters a new physical body appropriate to its karmic condition, carrying forward tendencies and patterns.

The wind-fragrance simile is apt: you can't see fragrance move, yet it clearly does. Similarly, the soul's transmigration is invisible yet evident in its effects—the birth of a new being with predispositions that cannot be explained by heredity alone.`

    transliteration: 'śrotraṁ cakṣuḥ sparśanaṁ ca rasanaṁ ghrāṇam eva ca\nadhiṣṭhāya manaś cāyaṁ viṣayān upasevate',
    translation: 'Presiding over hearing, sight, touch, taste, smell, and also the mind, this one (the jīva) enjoys the sense objects.',
    commentary: `In each body, the jīva presides over the senses—hearing, sight, touch, taste, smell—and the mind. Through these, it "enjoys" (upasevate) the sense objects. The body is the instrument; the jīva is the experiencer.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this "presiding" and "enjoying" is the basis of bondage. The jīva identifies with the senses and becomes attached to their objects. The sense of "I see, I taste, I enjoy" creates the illusion of individual selfhood separate from the totality.

Yet this same mechanism can serve liberation. If the jīva can preside over senses, it can also witness them without identification. The capacity to observe "there is hearing" rather than "I hear" is the beginning of discrimination. The lord of the body can remember it is also a fragment of the supreme Lord.`

    transliteration: 'utkrāmantaṁ sthitaṁ vāpi bhuñjānaṁ vā guṇānvitam\nvimūḍhā nānupaśyanti paśyanti jñāna-cakṣuṣaḥ',
    translation: 'The deluded do not perceive the soul departing, or staying, or enjoying, or united with the gunas; but those with the eye of knowledge see.',
    commentary: `Two kinds of perception: the deluded (vimūḍhāḥ) do not see the soul at all—neither its departing (death), staying (life), nor enjoying (experience). Those with knowledge-eyes (jñāna-cakṣuṣaḥ) see clearly.

Shankaracharya explains that the soul's presence is not perceived by ordinary senses. We see the body, hear speech, observe behavior—but the presiding jīva remains invisible. Only the eye of wisdom, developed through practice and discrimination, perceives the subtle reality.

This explains why materialists deny the soul: they look with physical eyes and see only physical things. The jīva is not material; it cannot be seen materially. Yet those who have refined their perception through spiritual practice see what is invisible to gross sight. The difference is not intelligence but the organ of perception.`

    transliteration: 'dvāv imau puruṣau loke kṣaraś cākṣara eva ca\nkṣaraḥ sarvāṇi bhūtāni kūṭastho\'kṣara ucyate',
    translation: 'There are two purushas in the world: the perishable and the imperishable. All beings are the perishable; the unchanging is called the imperishable.',
    commentary: `Krishna distinguishes two purushas: kṣara (perishable)—all beings in manifestation—and akṣara (imperishable)—the unchanging principle. The entire manifest world is kṣara; the unmanifest ground is akṣara. These are the two aspects of existence.

Shankaracharya identifies kṣara with the totality of jīvas and akṣara with māyā-śakti or the seed-state of manifestation. Both are aspects of the Divine, but neither is the ultimate. The setup is for verse 17's revelation.

This teaching clarifies the levels of reality. The changing world we experience is real at its level but perishable. Behind it is an unchanging ground that makes change possible. But neither the changing nor the unchanging, in isolation, is the complete truth. Something more is needed.`

    transliteration: 'uttamaḥ puruṣas tv anyaḥ paramātmety udāhṛtaḥ\nyo loka-trayam āviśya bibharty avyaya īśvaraḥ',
    translation: 'But other than these is the Supreme Person, called the Paramatman, who, entering the three worlds, sustains them—the imperishable Lord.',
    commentary: `Beyond kṣara and akṣara is a third: uttama puruṣa, the Supreme Person. He is called Paramātmā—the Supreme Self. Entering the three worlds, He sustains all. He is avyaya (imperishable) and īśvara (Lord).

This is the heart of the chapter and gives it its name: Puruṣottama Yoga. Krishna is not just the perishable (which He also is, as all beings), not just the imperishable (which He also is, as the ground), but beyond both—the Supreme Person who includes and transcends.

For the bhakta, this is crucial: God is not an impersonal absolute but a Supreme Person. Not limited by personality as humans are, but possessing personality in the highest sense—consciousness, will, love. The impersonal Brahman and the personal Lord are not two; they are aspects of Puruṣottama.`

    commentary: `Krishna declares His identity: "I transcend the perishable and am higher than the imperishable—therefore I am Puruṣottama." This is not arrogance but revelation. The Supreme Person is speaking, and He is identifying Himself.

Shankaracharya notes that this transcends both the world of change (kṣara) and the unchanging ground (akṣara). Krishna is not merely one among beings, nor is He only the impersonal absolute. He is beyond both categories—the one reality that includes all others.

"Celebrated in world and Vedas" indicates that this is not Krishna's private claim but the testimony of scripture and tradition. The Vedas, when rightly understood, point to this Supreme Person. He is what all teachings ultimately reveal.`

    commentary: `The fruit of this knowledge: one who knows Krishna as Puruṣottama without delusion (asammūḍhaḥ) is "sarva-vit"—knower of all. Such a one worships Krishna with entire being (sarva-bhāvena). Complete knowledge produces complete devotion.

From the Advaitic-bhakti synthesis, this verse shows that knowledge and devotion culminate together. Knowing Krishna as Supreme Person is not dry intellectualism; it flowers into whole-being worship. And devotion to Puruṣottama is not sentimental; it is grounded in understanding.

"Knowing all" does not mean factual omniscience but essential knowledge—knowing what matters, what is real, what the purpose of life is. One who knows the Supreme Person knows the source and goal of everything. All other knowledge is footnotes.`

    commentary: `Krishna concludes: this is the "most secret teaching" (guhyatamam śāstram)—the essence of all scripture. Understanding this makes one truly wise (buddhimān) and one who has fulfilled all duties (kṛta-kṛtyaḥ). Nothing more needs to be done.

Shankaracharya emphasizes "most secret"—not because it should be hidden but because it is subtle, easily misunderstood, and precious. The teaching of Puruṣottama is the crown of Vedantic wisdom, revealing what the Upanishads gesture toward.

"Has fulfilled all duties" (kṛta-kṛtyaḥ) is the ultimate liberation. All the obligations that bind human life are completed in this knowledge. Not that ritual or ethics become irrelevant, but that the fundamental duty—to know the Self and its relation to the Supreme—is accomplished. Everything else flows from this.`
