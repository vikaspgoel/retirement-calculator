    translation: 'Arjuna said: Those devotees who, ever steadfast, worship You in this manner, and those who worship the imperishable, unmanifested—which of them are better versed in yoga?',
    commentary: `Arjuna asks the perennial question: is it better to worship God with form (saguna) or without form (nirguna)? Some devotees focus on Krishna as personal Lord; others on the imperishable, unmanifest Absolute. Which path is superior?

This question arises naturally after the cosmic vision of Chapter 11. Arjuna saw both the personal and cosmic aspects of Krishna. Now he wonders: for practice, which should be primary? The personal seems accessible but limited; the impersonal seems ultimate but abstract.

The question acknowledges two valid approaches. Some temperaments naturally gravitate toward relationship with a personal Divine; others toward merging with formless consciousness. Krishna will honor both while expressing preference—and explaining why.`

  // Krishna's answer - devotion to Me is easier

    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nmayy āveśya mano ye māṁ nitya-yuktā upāsate\nśraddhayā parayopetās te me yuktatamā matāḥ',
    translation: 'The Lord said: Those who, fixing their mind on Me, worship Me, ever steadfast and endowed with supreme faith—them I consider to be most perfect in yoga.',
    commentary: `Krishna's clear answer: those who worship Him with focused mind, steadfast devotion, and supreme faith are "most perfect in yoga" (yuktatamā). The personal path receives explicit endorsement from the personal Lord.

Shankaracharya notes that this does not invalidate the impersonal path but indicates that for most seekers, the personal approach is more accessible and effective. Faith (śraddhā) and steadfastness (nitya-yuktā) are easier to cultivate toward a personal form than toward an abstraction.

"Supreme faith" (parayā śraddhayā) is key. Half-hearted devotion yields half-hearted results. The bhakta who surrenders completely, holding nothing back, progresses rapidly. This totality of surrender is the heart of bhakti yoga.`

    transliteration: 'ye tv akṣaram anirdeśyam avyaktaṁ paryupāsate\nsarvatra-gam acintyaṁ ca kūṭa-stham acalaṁ dhruvam',
    translation: 'But those who worship the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifested, the all-pervading, the inconceivable, the unchanging, the immovable, the eternal...',
    commentary: `Krishna now describes the impersonal approach: worship of the akshara (imperishable) that is indefinable (anirdeśya), unmanifest (avyaktam), all-pervading (sarvatra-gam), inconceivable (acintyam), unchanging (kūṭa-stham), immovable (acalam), and eternal (dhruvam).

These attributes describe the absolute Brahman of Advaita—the formless, attributeless reality beyond all description. This is what the jnani seeks: not a God to worship but the Ground of Being to recognize as one's own nature.

The string of negative descriptions points to the difficulty: how do you worship what cannot be defined, imagined, or grasped? The impersonal path requires extraordinary subtlety of mind. Most seekers need something to hold onto.`

    transliteration: 'sanniyamyendriya-grāmaṁ sarvatra sama-buddhayaḥ\nte prāpnuvanti mām eva sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ',
    translation: '...having controlled all the senses, even-minded everywhere, engaged in the welfare of all beings—they also reach Me alone.',
    commentary: `Even the impersonal seekers, if they control senses, maintain equanimity, and serve all beings, "reach Me alone" (mām eva). The paths converge. Personal devotion and impersonal realization arrive at the same destination.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that the goal is one; only the approaches differ. The jnani who realizes Brahman and the bhakta who loves Krishna discover the same reality. The Self and the Lord are not two.

"Engaged in the welfare of all beings" (sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ) is significant. Even the impersonal path does not lead to withdrawal from compassion. Recognition of the One in all naturally produces care for all. Abstract realization has concrete ethical implications.`

    transliteration: 'kleśo\'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām\navyaktā hi gatir duḥkhaṁ dehavadbhir avāpyate',
    translation: 'Greater is the difficulty of those whose minds are set on the unmanifested, for the goal of the unmanifested is hard for embodied beings to reach.',
    commentary: `Here is Krishna's reservation about the impersonal path: it is more difficult (kleśo'dhikataraḥ). For embodied beings (dehavadbhiḥ), the unmanifest goal is reached with great hardship (duḥkham). The body-mind wants something to relate to.

From the Advaitic perspective, this verse acknowledges practical reality. While the formless Brahman is ultimately true, humans have forms, senses, and minds that function through relationship. Asking them to leap directly to the formless often produces frustration.

This is not disparagement of the jnana path but recognition of human limitation. For those rare souls capable of direct insight into the formless, that path works. For most, the personal approach provides intermediate support that eventually leads to the same realization.`

    transliteration: 'ye tu sarvāṇi karmāṇi mayi sannyasya mat-parāḥ\nananyenaiva yogena māṁ dhyāyanta upāsate',
    translation: 'But those who, renouncing all actions in Me, regarding Me as the supreme, worship Me, meditating on Me with undivided yoga...',
    commentary: `The bhakti alternative: renouncing all actions to Krishna (mayi sannyasya), regarding Him as supreme (mat-parāḥ), worshipping with undivided attention (ananyena yogena). This is the path of total devotion—nothing held back, nothing divided.

"Undivided yoga" (ananyena yogena) is the key phrase. The mind that is scattered among many objects cannot be devoted. The bhakta gathers all attention and directs it toward the beloved Lord. This concentration of love produces rapid transformation.

"Renouncing all actions in Me" does not mean stopping action but offering its fruits. The devotee continues to act but no longer claims the results as personal. Everything is Krishna's—the action, the ability, the outcome. This surrender is the essence of bhakti karma yoga.`

    translation: '...for them, whose minds are set on Me, I become the deliverer from the ocean of death and rebirth, O Partha—before long.',
    commentary: `The promise: "I become the deliverer" (ahaṁ samuddhartā). For those devoted to Him, Krishna personally rescues from the ocean of samsara. And "not long" (na cirāt)—this is not a distant promise but an imminent one.

Shankaracharya sees this as the grace dimension of bhakti. The jnani may feel they must accomplish liberation through their own effort. The bhakta knows that surrender brings divine help. The Lord is not passive; He actively delivers those who turn to Him.

"Ocean of death and rebirth" (mṛtyu-saṁsāra-sāgarāt) captures the magnitude of what we're trapped in. It's not a pond we can wade across but an ocean requiring rescue. The devotee's role is to surrender; Krishna's role is to deliver. This is the covenant of bhakti.`

    transliteration: 'mayy eva mana ādhatsva mayi buddhiṁ niveśaya\nnivasiṣyasi mayy eva ata ūrdhvaṁ na saṁśayaḥ',
    translation: 'Fix your mind on Me alone, let your intellect dwell in Me. You will live in Me alone hereafter—of this there is no doubt.',
    commentary: `The instruction is simple: fix mind (manas) and intellect (buddhi) on Krishna. The promise is sure: you will dwell in Me (nivasiṣyasi mayy eva). "No doubt" (na saṁśayaḥ) emphasizes certainty—this is guaranteed.

From the bhakti standpoint, this is the essential practice: constant remembrance. Where attention goes, identity follows. If mind and intellect are consistently directed toward the Divine, one becomes established in divine consciousness. It is almost mechanical in its reliability.

"Hereafter" (ata ūrdhvam) can mean after death or from now onward. Both are true. The devotee who fixes attention on Krishna lives with Him now and continues with Him beyond death. The relationship established in life persists.`

    transliteration: 'atha cittaṁ samādhātuṁ na śaknoṣi mayi sthiram\nabhyāsa-yogena tato mām icchāptuṁ dhanañjaya',
    translation: 'If you are unable to fix your mind steadily on Me, then seek to reach Me by the yoga of practice, O Dhananjaya.',
    commentary: `Krishna acknowledges difficulty and offers an alternative: if you cannot fix the mind steadily, then practice (abhyāsa-yoga). Repeated effort over time accomplishes what sudden fixing cannot. This is grace—meeting people where they are.

Shankaracharya notes that abhyāsa means repeated effort to bring the wandering mind back. The mind will wander; that is its nature. The practice is not to prevent wandering but to return again and again. Over time, the intervals of steadiness increase.

This teaching is enormously encouraging. Most people cannot simply fix their mind on God and keep it there. Krishna knows this and provides a path: practice. Don't despair at initial failure; keep trying. The trying itself is the practice.`

    transliteration: 'abhyāse\'py asamartho\'si mat-karma-paramo bhava\nmad-artham api karmāṇi kurvan siddhim avāpsyasi',
    translation: 'If you are unable even to practice, then be intent on working for Me. Even performing actions for My sake, you will attain perfection.',
    commentary: `Even practice is too much? Then just work for Me (mat-karma-paramo bhava). Dedicate your ordinary activities to Krishna. Even this will lead to perfection (siddhim avāpsyasi). The path keeps becoming more accessible.

From the practical standpoint, this opens bhakti to everyone. Can't meditate? Can't even practice regularly? Fine—just do whatever you do as an offering. Cook for Krishna, clean for Krishna, work for Krishna. The action becomes sanctified by intention.

This is karma yoga infused with bhakti. The action may be ordinary—cooking, cleaning, accounting—but the orientation transforms it. "I do this for You, not for me." This simple shift of motivation, maintained consistently, eventually produces the same realization as formal practice.`

    transliteration: 'athaitad apy aśakto\'si kartuṁ mad-yogam āśritaḥ\nsarva-karma-phala-tyāgaṁ tataḥ kuru yatātmavān',
    translation: 'If you are unable to do even this, then, taking refuge in My yoga, renounce the fruit of all action, being self-controlled.',
    commentary: `The final fallback: if you cannot even dedicate actions to Krishna, then simply renounce the fruits. Give up attachment to results. This is the most accessible form of practice, requiring only a shift in attitude.

Shankaracharya sees this as Krishna progressively lowering the bar until even the weakest aspirant can participate. Can't fix mind? Practice. Can't practice? Work for Me. Can't even work for Me? Just let go of results. Surely this much is possible.

The genius here is psychological. The ego clings most tightly to results. Loosening that grip, even without explicit devotion, begins the dissolution of ego. And as ego weakens, the capacity for deeper practice naturally develops. Start where you can; progress will follow.`

    translation: 'Better indeed is knowledge than practice; better than knowledge is meditation; better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for from renunciation comes peace immediately.',
    commentary: `A hierarchy: knowledge better than mechanical practice, meditation better than intellectual knowledge, fruit-renunciation better than meditation, and from renunciation comes immediate peace. The progression moves toward increasing simplicity and effectiveness.

This verse has sparked much commentary. Shankaracharya interprets it as stages for different capacities: some need practice, some can go straight to knowledge, some directly to meditation, some simply to letting go. The best approach depends on the individual.

"Peace immediately" (śāntir anantaram) is the promise for renunciation of fruits. While other practices take time to mature, simply letting go of results brings instant relief. The burden we carry is largely about outcomes; release outcomes, and the burden lifts.`

    transliteration: 'adveṣṭā sarva-bhūtānāṁ maitraḥ karuṇa eva ca\nnirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ kṣamī',
    translation: 'One who hates no being, who is friendly and compassionate, free from possessiveness and ego, equal in pain and pleasure, forgiving...',
    commentary: `Now Krishna describes His beloved devotee. The first qualities: no hatred for any being (adveṣṭā), friendliness (maitraḥ), compassion (karuṇaḥ), freedom from "mine" (nirmamaḥ) and "I" (nirahaṅkāraḥ), equanimity in pain and pleasure, forgiveness (kṣamī).

These are not arbitrary preferences but natural results of devotion. One who loves Krishna sees Krishna in all beings—how can such a one hate? The absence of ego-attachment makes possessiveness impossible. Equanimity arises from resting in something unchanging.

This list can serve as a self-assessment: Do I hate anyone? Am I friendly and compassionate? Do I cling to "mine" and "I"? Can I bear pain and pleasure equally? Do I forgive? Honest answers show where practice is needed.`

    translation: '...ever content, steady in yoga, self-controlled, of firm resolve, with mind and intellect dedicated to Me—such a devotee is dear to Me.',
    commentary: `The list continues: ever content (santuṣṭaḥ satatam), steady in yoga, self-controlled, firm in resolve (dṛḍha-niścayaḥ), with mind and intellect offered to Krishna. "Such a devotee is dear to Me" (sa me priyaḥ)—the explicit statement of divine love.

"Ever content" is remarkable. Not content when things go well, but constantly content—in success or failure, gain or loss. This contentment is not complacency but trust: whatever comes is Krishna's gift, and Krishna knows best.

"Dear to Me" makes devotion relational. Krishna is not an impersonal principle that doesn't care; He has preferences, He has beloveds. This personal dimension is the heart of bhakti—not just approaching God, but being welcomed, valued, loved.`

    commentary: `The devotee neither disturbs others nor is disturbed by them. Free from the reactive emotions—elation (harṣa), anger/envy (amarṣa), fear (bhaya), anxiety (udvega)—they move through the world without creating or experiencing friction.

This is profound psychological health. Most of us disturb and are disturbed constantly—our moods ripple outward, others' moods ripple into us. The dear devotee has become stable enough to neither send nor receive these disturbances.

"Free from joy" surprises. Is joy not good? Here harṣa means the excited, grasping joy that depends on circumstances—not the deep contentment mentioned earlier. The devotee is released from the rollercoaster of reactive emotions, resting in something more stable.`

"Renouncing all undertakings" does not mean inaction but release of personal agenda. The devotee may be very active (dakṣaḥ—capable), but the action flows from surrender, not from personal project. No "I" is building an empire or securing a legacy.

"Unconcerned" (udāsīnaḥ) is literally "sitting apart"—not indifferent but not entangled. The devotee engages without being caught. Events happen; responses arise; but no anxiety accompanies them. This is freedom in action.`

    commentary: `The devotee is beyond the pairs: not rejoicing (na hṛṣyati), not hating (na dveṣṭi), not grieving (na śocati), not desiring (na kāṅkṣati). Even good and evil (śubhāśubha) are renounced. Full of devotion (bhaktimān), such a one is dear.

"Renouncing good and evil" is radical. Even the attachment to being good must go. The devotee acts rightly not to be good but because that's what flows from alignment with Krishna. Personal virtue as project is still ego.

This describes someone who has passed beyond the moral stage into the spiritual. Not that they act immorally—far from it—but that morality is no longer effortful or self-conscious. Good action flows naturally from their state, without pride or comparison.`

    translation: 'The same toward enemy and friend, in honor and dishonor, in cold and heat, in pleasure and pain, the same, free from attachment...',
    commentary: `Equanimity spans all dualities: enemy/friend (relationships), honor/dishonor (reputation), cold/heat (physical), pleasure/pain (emotional). "The same" (samaḥ) does not mean treating them identically but maintaining inner stability regardless of which is present.

"Free from attachment" (saṅga-vivarjitaḥ) is the key. Attachment to friends makes enemies hateful; attachment to honor makes dishonor painful; attachment to comfort makes discomfort unbearable. Remove attachment, and the same equanimity pervades all experience.

This is the sthitaprajna (steady-minded one) described in Chapter 2, now in the context of bhakti. The path of devotion produces the same psychological freedom as the path of knowledge. Love of Krishna makes one imperturbable.`

"Content with anything" is the ultimate flexibility—not demanding specific conditions but finding sufficiency in whatever is present. "Homeless" indicates non-attachment to place, identity, security. The devotee's home is in Krishna, not in any worldly location.

"Silent" (maunī) suggests one who speaks little, whose energy is turned inward. Not that the devotee never speaks, but that unnecessary speech has fallen away. What remains is essential communication, not chatter.`

    translation: 'But those who follow this immortal dharma as declared, with faith, regarding Me as supreme—those devotees are exceedingly dear to Me.',
    commentary: `The chapter concludes with emphasis: those who follow this "immortal dharma" (dharmyāmṛtam) with faith (śraddadhānāḥ), regarding Krishna as supreme (mat-paramāḥ), are "exceedingly dear" (atīva me priyāḥ)—the superlative of devotion's reward.

"Immortal dharma" suggests that these teachings are not temporary rules but eternal principles. Following them aligns one with cosmic order. The reward is not just future liberation but present intimacy with the Divine.

"Exceedingly dear" is personal language. Krishna does not say they are most advanced or most realized—though that may be true—but that they are most beloved. This is the bhakti promise: approach God with love, and God loves you back. The relationship is not one-sided.`
