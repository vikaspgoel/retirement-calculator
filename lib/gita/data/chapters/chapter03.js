    sanskrit: 'न हि कश्चित्क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत् |\nकार्यते ह्यवशः कर्म सर्वः प्रकृतिजैर्गुणैः ||',
    transliteration: 'na hi kaścit kṣaṇam api jātu tiṣṭhaty akarma-kṛt\nkāryate hy avaśaḥ karma sarvaḥ prakṛti-jair guṇaiḥ',
    translation: 'No one can remain even for a moment without performing action. Everyone is helplessly driven to action by the qualities born of nature.',
    commentary: `Krishna states a fact: action is unavoidable. Even sitting still involves action—breathing, thinking, maintaining the body. The gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) constantly interact, producing movement. Claiming to do nothing is self-deception.\n\nFrom the Advaitic standpoint, this verse applies to embodied beings who have not realized the Self. The enlightened may appear to act, but they are established in the actionless witness. For everyone else, the gunas compel activity—the only choice is what kind of action.\n\nSince action is inevitable, the question becomes: what action, and with what attitude? Suppressing action only redirects energy into mental agitation. The wise accept that action will occur and focus on purifying its quality and releasing attachment to its fruits.`

    transliteration: 'yas tv indriyāṇi manasā niyamyārabhate\'rjuna\nkarmendriyaiḥ karma-yogam asaktaḥ sa viśiṣyate',
    translation: 'But one who, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages in karma yoga with the organs of action, without attachment—that one excels.',
    commentary: `The contrast: not pretending to renounce while craving, but acting while genuinely unattached. The senses are controlled by mind (not suppressed), and the body engages in appropriate action. This person "excels" (viśiṣyate)—is truly superior.\n\nFrom the Advaitic view, the key is "without attachment" (asaktaḥ). The same action can be binding or liberating depending on the inner orientation. Acting with attachment creates karma; acting without attachment purifies. The outer behavior may look identical; the inner state determines the result.\n\nThis is the practical teaching: engage fully in your duties, but hold the results loosely. Work with your whole heart, then release. This combination of full engagement and inner freedom is the essence of karma yoga.`

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',

    themes: ['duty', 'action'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'नियतं कुरु कर्म त्वं कर्म ज्यायो ह्यकर्मणः |\nशरीरयात्रापि च ते न प्रसिद्ध्येदकर्मणः ||',
    transliteration: 'niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ\nśarīra-yātrāpi ca te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ',
    translation: 'Perform your ordained duty, for action is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of your body would not be possible through inaction.',
    commentary: `The instruction is direct: do your duty (niyataṁ karma). Action is better than inaction—at minimum, the body requires maintenance. Even the most renounced sage must eat, breathe, and move. Total inaction is impossible.\n\nShankaracharya notes that "ordained duty" refers to obligatory actions according to one's station and nature. These are not optional. The question is not whether to act but how to act—with attachment or without, for ego or for offering.\n\nThis verse is practical wisdom: don't use spirituality as an excuse for paralysis. Life requires engagement. The spiritual path is not about avoiding life but transforming how we participate in it. Do what needs to be done, and do it as an offering.`

    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['action', 'surrender', 'detachment'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः |\nतदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्गः समाचर ||',
    transliteration: 'yajñārthāt karmaṇo\'nyatra loko\'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ\ntad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara',
    translation: 'The world is bound by action other than that performed for sacrifice. For the sake of sacrifice, O son of Kunti, perform action free from attachment.',
    commentary: `Here is the key: action performed as yajna (sacrifice/offering) does not bind. All other action creates bondage. The same deed—done for personal gain, it binds; done as offering, it liberates. The difference is not what you do but why and how.\n\nFrom the Advaitic view, "yajna" means offering action to the Divine, to the larger whole. When we act for "me and mine," we strengthen ego and create karma. When we act as instruments, offering results to the Whole, the action flows through us without sticking.\n\n"Free from attachment" (mukta-saṅgaḥ) is the operational instruction. Perform your duty, but release the outcome. This does not mean not caring—it means not clinging. Care deeply, work skillfully, then surrender results. This is the alchemy that transforms ordinary action into spiritual practice.`

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q1'],
    themes: ['duty', 'action', 'ignorance'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः |\nअघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति ||',
    transliteration: 'evaṁ pravartitaṁ cakraṁ nānuvartayatīha yaḥ\naghāyur indriyārāmo moghaṁ pārtha sa jīvati ||',
    translation: 'One who does not follow this cycle thus set in motion, O Partha, lives in vain, indulging in the senses, a life of sin.',
    commentary: `Krishna warns against not participating in the cosmic cycle of action and interdependence. To live solely for sense pleasure (indriyārāmo) and not contribute to the whole (yajna) is to live a sinful (aghāyur) and vain (moghaṁ) life.

Shankaracharya explains that this cycle of action (chakraṁ) is the natural order of the world, where beings sustain each other through their duties. To opt out of this is to disrupt dharma and accumulate negative karma.

This verse is a reminder that individual existence is part of a larger web. True fulfillment comes not from isolation or pure consumption, but from conscious contribution and participation. Living a meaningful life involves recognizing one's role and fulfilling it as an offering, rather than living only for oneself.`

    themes: ['action', 'detachment'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'तस्मादसक्तः सततं कार्यं कर्म समाचर |\nअसक्तो ह्याचरन्कर्म परमाप्नोति पूरुषः ||',
    transliteration: 'tasmād asaktaḥ satataṁ kāryaṁ karma samācara |\nasakto hy ācaran karma param āpnoti pūruṣaḥ ||',
    translation: 'Therefore, without attachment, constantly perform your duty, for by performing action without attachment, one attains the Supreme.',
    commentary: `Krishna reinforces the core teaching: perform your duty (kāryaṁ karma) without attachment (asakto). This repeated emphasis highlights its centrality in karma yoga. The reward is not worldly success but attaining the Supreme (param āpnoti)—liberation.

Shankaracharya reiterates that this is the path to inner purification. When action is freed from personal desire for results, it no longer binds. The individual becomes an instrument of a larger will, and this selfless action cleanses the mind.

This verse encourages perseverance. It's not enough to know the theory; one must consistently apply it. Every action, big or small, becomes an opportunity for spiritual growth when approached with detachment. This is the practical path to transforming worldly life into a spiritual journey.`

    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'कर्मणैव हि संसिद्धिमास्थिता जनकादयः |\nलोकसंग्रहमेवापि सम्पश्यन्कर्तुमर्हसि ||',
    transliteration: 'karmaṇaiva hi saṁsiddhim āsthitā janakādayaḥ\nloka-saṅgraham evāpi sampaśyan kartum arhasi',
    translation: 'By action alone, Janaka and others attained perfection. Even considering the welfare of the world, you should act.',
    commentary: `Krishna cites King Janaka—a realized sage who continued to rule his kingdom. Perfection did not require abandoning responsibilities. Even the wise act, not for personal need but for "world welfare" (loka-sangraha)—maintaining social order and inspiring others.\n\nShankaracharya explains that Janaka and other ancient kings had attained Self-knowledge, yet they continued their duties. Their action was not from personal need but from compassion—showing others that action and wisdom can coexist.\n
This verse addresses a subtle ego: "I'm too spiritual for ordinary duties." The truly wise recognize that their visible engagement helps others. By acting rightly, they demonstrate that realization does not mean withdrawal. Leadership includes showing the way through one's own example.`

    sanskrit: 'सक्ताः कर्मण्यविद्वांसो यथा कुर्वन्ति भारत |\nकुर्याद्विद्वांस्तथासक्तश्चिकीर्षुर्लोकसंग्रहम् ||',
    transliteration: 'saktāḥ karmaṇy avidvāṁso yathā kurvanti bhārata\nkuryād vidvāṁs tathāsaktaś cikīrṣur loka-saṅgraham',
    translation: 'As the ignorant act with attachment, O Bharata, so should the wise act without attachment, wishing to maintain the world order.',
    commentary: `A remarkable instruction: the wise should act as energetically as the ignorant—but without attachment. The outer appearance may be similar; the inner orientation differs completely. The ignorant act from desire; the wise act from understanding, for the world's welfare.\n\nFrom the Advaitic standpoint, this prevents the wise from becoming ineffective or withdrawn. Their freedom from attachment should not translate into lack of engagement. Rather, that very freedom allows them to act more effectively, without the distortions that personal agenda introduces.\n\n"Loka-sangraha" (maintaining world order) suggests that individual realization has social implications. The realized person becomes a stabilizing force in the world—not by imposing anything, but by embodying harmony. Their action, arising from clarity, naturally serves the whole.`

    sanskrit: 'प्रकृतेः क्रियमाणानि गुणैः कर्माणि सर्वशः |\nअहङ्कारविमूढात्मा कर्ताहमिति मन्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ\nahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate',
    translation: 'Actions are performed entirely by the gunas of prakriti. One whose mind is deluded by ego thinks, "I am the doer."',
    commentary: `This verse reveals the metaphysics behind karma yoga. Actions are actually performed by the gunas (qualities of nature); the Self does nothing. But the ego (ahaṅkāra) claims doership: "I am doing this." This claim is the root of bondage.\n\nShankaracharya explains that all activity belongs to prakriti (nature), not to the Self. The body moves, the mind thinks, the senses perceive—all prakriti. The Self is the unchanging witness. But identification with body-mind creates the illusion "I am acting."\n\nUnderstanding this transforms action. When we see that "we" are not actually doing anything—that nature operates through us—the grip of doership loosens. We can then act without the burden of personal agency. The action happens; the Self remains uninvolved.`

    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'मयि सर्वाणि कर्माणि संन्यस्याध्यात्मचेतसा |\nनिराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः ||',
    transliteration: 'mayi sarvāṇi karmāṇi saṁnyasyādhyātma-cetasā |\nnirāśīr nirmamo bhūtvā yudhyasva vigata-jvaraḥ ||',
    translation: 'Renouncing all actions in Me, with mind fixed on the Self, free from hope and selfishness, fight without the fever of grief.',
    commentary: `Krishna instructs Arjuna to surrender all actions to Him, with a mind focused on the Self. This is the integration of karma yoga and jnana yoga. Act, but let the actions be an offering, free from hope for results (nirāśīḥ) and the sense of "mine" (nirmamo). Fight (yudhyasva) without fever or grief (vigata-jvaraḥ).\n\nShankaracharya clarifies that "renouncing all actions in Me" means seeing Krishna as the Self, the Supreme Reality. When actions are seen as flowing from and returning to the Divine, they no longer create personal bondage. The focus shifts from the personal doer to the universal flow.\n\nThis verse is a call to fearless action grounded in wisdom. When there is no personal agenda, no attachment to outcome, no sense of separate doership, action becomes pure and powerful. The "fever of grief" (vigata-jvaraḥ) is the anxiety that comes from clinging to results. Release that, and you fight with inner peace.`

    transliteration: 'sadṛśaṁ ceṣṭate svasyāḥ prakṛter jñānavān api |\nprakṛtiṁ yānti bhūtāni nigrahaḥ kiṁ kariṣyati ||',
    translation: 'Even a wise person acts according to their own nature; all beings follow their nature. What can restraint do?',
    commentary: `Krishna points out that everyone, even the wise, acts according to their inherent nature (prakṛti). All beings are bound by their nature. This raises the question: if nature is so powerful, what is the use of restraint (nigrahaḥ)?\n\nShankaracharya explains that even the wise person's body-mind complex acts according to its gunas. However, the wise person knows "I am not this nature." The ignorant person identifies with it. Restraint cannot fundamentally change nature, but understanding can prevent identification with it.\n\nThis verse is not an excuse for inaction or surrender to impulse. Rather, it is a call to recognize the power of nature and to work with it, not against it. True wisdom is to understand one's nature and act in harmony with it, without attachment to the results or the sense of personal doership.`

    translation: 'It is better to perform one's own duty, though imperfectly, than to perform another's duty perfectly. Death in one's own duty is better; the duty of another is fraught with danger.',
    commentary: `A foundational teaching on dharma: it is better to perform one's own prescribed duty (sva-dharmo), even if imperfectly (viguṇaḥ), than to perfectly perform another's duty (para-dharmāt sv-anuṣṭhitāt). Dying in one's own dharma is superior; another's dharma is dangerous (bhayāvahaḥ).\n\nShankaracharya explains that "sva-dharma" refers to duties appropriate to one's station, skills, and stage of life. To abandon one's own dharma for another's, even if that other seems more noble, leads to confusion and spiritual downfall. Arjuna's duty is to fight, not to become a renunciate.\n\nThis verse is a powerful affirmation of authenticity. Don't try to be someone you're not. Understand your unique gifts and responsibilities, and commit to them fully. The path to freedom is through fulfilling one's own truth, not through imitation. The "danger" (bhayāvahaḥ) of another's dharma is the inner conflict and ineffectiveness that arise from acting against one's true nature.`

    translation: 'Knowledge is covered by this eternal enemy of the wise, O son of Kunti, in the form of desire, which is insatiable as fire.',
    commentary: `Krishna reiterates that knowledge (jñānam) is covered by desire (kāma-rūpeṇa)—the eternal enemy of the wise. Desire is described as insatiable (duṣpūreṇa) and like fire (analena ca)—it constantly consumes but is never satisfied.\n\nShankaracharya emphasizes that desire is not just a problem for the ignorant; it is an "eternal enemy" (nitya-vairiṇā) even for those on the path of wisdom, as it constantly threatens to obscure clarity. It's a subtle and powerful force.\n\nThis verse is a warning: don't underestimate the power of desire. It requires constant vigilance and understanding. The path to wisdom involves seeing desire for what it is—a covering, not an inherent part of who you are—and learning to transcend its pull.`

    translation: 'Therefore, O best of the Bharatas, first control your senses, and then slay this sinful destroyer of knowledge and realization, desire.',
    commentary: `Krishna gives a clear and actionable instruction: first control the senses (indriyāṇy ādau niyamya). This is the initial step in conquering desire. Only then can one slay desire (pāpmānaṁ prajahi), which is the destroyer of both theoretical knowledge (jñāna) and experiential realization (vijñāna).\n\nShankaracharya highlights the importance of sequence: external control (senses) leads to internal control (desire). Trying to tackle desire directly without managing the senses is often ineffective. The senses are the gateways through which desire enters and is nourished.\n\nThis verse provides a practical strategy for inner transformation. Don't try to be a renunciate if your senses are still unruly. Start with self-discipline, with conscious choice in what you engage with. As the senses come under control, the power of desire naturally weakens, and the path to knowledge and realization becomes clear.`

    translation: 'They say the senses are superior to the body; the mind is superior to the senses; the intellect is superior to the mind; and the Self is superior to the intellect.',
    commentary: `Krishna establishes a hierarchy of inner faculties. The senses are superior to the gross body; the mind (manas) is superior to the senses (as it coordinates them); the intellect (buddhi) is superior to the mind (as it discriminates); and finally, the Self (saḥ) is superior to the intellect itself.\n\nShankaracharya explains this as a ladder of abstraction and subtlety. The gross is controlled by the subtle. To control the senses, control the mind. To control the mind, use the intellect. But ultimately, true freedom comes from identifying with the Self, which transcends even the intellect.\n\nThis verse provides a roadmap for self-mastery. Don't try to control the senses directly; address the mind. Don't try to control the mind directly; use your intellect. But ultimately, realize that you are beyond all these instruments. This understanding empowers you to use them wisely rather than being controlled by them.`

    translation: 'Thus knowing that which is higher than the intellect, and steadying the self by the Self, slay the enemy in the form of desire, O mighty-armed, which is hard to overcome.',
    commentary: `The chapter concludes with a call to action: knowing the Self that transcends intellect, stabilizing oneself in that knowledge, destroy the enemy—desire. The epithet "mighty-armed" (mahā-bāho) reminds Arjuna that he has the strength for this battle.\n\nShankaracharya explains "higher than intellect" as the Self (Ātman), which is beyond all mental functions. "Steadying the self by the Self" means using the higher wisdom to stabilize the lower mind. From that stability, desire can be conquered.\n\nThis verse transforms the external battle into an internal one. The real war is not on Kurukshetra but within. The enemy is not the Kauravas but desire. And the weapon is not the Gandiva bow but Self-knowledge. Win this inner battle, and the outer battle—whatever form it takes—becomes manageable.`
