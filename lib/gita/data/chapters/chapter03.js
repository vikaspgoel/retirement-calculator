    sanskrit: 'अर्जुन उवाच |\nज्यायसी चेत्कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिर्जनार्दन |\nतत्किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि केशव ||',
    transliteration: 'arjuna uvāca\njyāyasī cet karmaṇas te matā buddhir janārdana\ntat kiṁ karmaṇi ghore māṁ niyojayasi keśava',
    translation: 'Arjuna said: If you consider knowledge superior to action, O Janardana, then why do you urge me to this terrible action, O Keshava?',
    commentary: `Arjuna's question reveals a common confusion: if wisdom is higher than action, why act at all? He sees contradiction where Krishna sees integration. This question opens the teaching on karma yoga—how action itself becomes a path to freedom.

Shankaracharya notes that Arjuna has understood Krishna's praise of knowledge but not its relationship to action. He thinks they are alternatives, when actually they are stages. For most people, action purifies the mind and prepares it for knowledge.

This question resonates with anyone who wonders: if spiritual realization is the goal, why engage with worldly duties? The answer Krishna will give transforms this either/or into a both/and—not knowledge versus action, but knowledge through right action.`

  // Krishna's answer - two paths

    themes: ['action', 'knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nलोकेऽस्मिन्द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयानघ |\nज्ञानयोगेन साङ्ख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् ||',
    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nloke\'smin dvi-vidhā niṣṭhā purā proktā mayānagha\njñāna-yogena sāṅkhyānāṁ karma-yogena yoginām',
    translation: 'The Lord said: In this world a twofold path was taught by Me of old, O sinless one: the path of knowledge for the contemplatives, and the path of action for the active.',
    commentary: `Krishna clarifies: there are two valid paths, not competing but suited to different temperaments. Jnana yoga for those inclined to contemplation (sankhyas), karma yoga for those inclined to action (yogis). Both lead to the same goal.

From the Advaitic view, this is not a hierarchy but a recognition of human diversity. Some minds naturally turn inward; for them, knowledge is direct. Others are constitutionally active; for them, action purified of ego becomes the vehicle. Neither path is superior—what matters is following one's nature.

This teaching liberates us from spiritual comparison. The question is not "which path is best?" but "which path suits me?" Arjuna is a man of action; telling him to sit and contemplate would violate his nature. Krishna will teach him to act in a way that leads to the same freedom that contemplation offers others.`

  // Cannot avoid action

    id: 'bg-3-4',
    chapter: 3,
    verse: 4,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q1', 'Q2'],
    themes: ['action', 'ignorance'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'न कर्मणामनारम्भान्नैष्कर्म्यं पुरुषोऽश्नुते |\nन च संन्यसनादेव सिद्धिं समधिगच्छति ||',
    transliteration: 'na karmaṇām anārambhān naiṣkarmyaṁ puruṣo\'śnute\nna ca sannyasanād eva siddhiṁ samadhigacchati',
    translation: 'Not by abstaining from action does a person attain freedom from action, nor by mere renunciation does one attain perfection.',
    commentary: `A crucial clarification: avoiding action does not produce the actionless state. Sitting still while the mind churns with desire is not freedom—it is suppression. True naishkarmya (actionlessness) is an inner state, not an outer posture.

Shankaracharya explains that "mere renunciation" (sannyasana) without knowledge is useless. One can renounce external activities while remaining internally agitated. The goal is freedom from the sense of doership, not freedom from physical movement.

This verse addresses spiritual bypassing—the attempt to skip the work of purification by simply withdrawing. Action done rightly purifies the mind; only a purified mind can sustain the recognition of the actionless Self. For most seekers, the path goes through engagement, not around it.`

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'न हि कश्चित्क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत् |\nकार्यते ह्यवशः कर्म सर्वः प्रकृतिजैर्गुणैः ||',
    transliteration: 'na hi kaścit kṣaṇam api jātu tiṣṭhaty akarma-kṛt\nkāryate hy avaśaḥ karma sarvaḥ prakṛti-jair guṇaiḥ',
    translation: 'No one can remain even for a moment without performing action. Everyone is helplessly driven to action by the qualities born of nature.',
    commentary: `Krishna states a fact: action is unavoidable. Even sitting still involves action—breathing, thinking, maintaining the body. The gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) constantly interact, producing movement. Claiming to do nothing is self-deception.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this verse applies to embodied beings who have not realized the Self. The enlightened may appear to act, but they are established in the actionless witness. For everyone else, the gunas compel activity—the only choice is what kind of action.

Since action is inevitable, the question becomes: what action, and with what attitude? Suppressing action only redirects energy into mental agitation. The wise accept that action will occur and focus on purifying its quality and releasing attachment to its fruits.`

  // The hypocrite vs. the sincere practitioner

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'कर्मेन्द्रियाणि संयम्य य आस्ते मनसा स्मरन् |\nइन्द्रियार्थान्विमूढात्मा मिथ्याचारः स उच्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'karmendriyāṇi saṁyamya ya āste manasā smaran\nindriyārthān vimūḍhātmā mithyācāraḥ sa ucyate',
    translation: 'One who restrains the organs of action but sits remembering sense objects in the mind—that deluded one is called a hypocrite.',
    commentary: `Krishna exposes false renunciation: externally still but internally churning with desire. The body may be controlled, but if the mind dwells on objects, this is hypocrisy (mithyachara). Better to act than to pretend not to want.

Shankaracharya is clear: this verse condemns spiritual pretense. The person who outwardly renounces while inwardly craving gains nothing. In fact, they are worse off—they have neither worldly enjoyment nor spiritual progress, only self-deception.

This teaching protects against premature renunciation. If desire is still strong, act—but act rightly. Suppression breeds shadow. The path is not to crush desire through willpower but to gradually purify it through understanding and right action until it naturally subsides.`

    transliteration: 'yas tv indriyāṇi manasā niyamyārabhate\'rjuna\nkarmendriyaiḥ karma-yogam asaktaḥ sa viśiṣyate',
    translation: 'But one who, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages in karma yoga with the organs of action, without attachment—that one excels.',
    commentary: `The contrast: not pretending to renounce while craving, but acting while genuinely unattached. The senses are controlled by mind (not suppressed), and the body engages in appropriate action. This person "excels" (viśiṣyate)—is truly superior.

From the Advaitic view, the key is "without attachment" (asaktaḥ). The same action can be binding or liberating depending on the inner orientation. Acting with attachment creates karma; acting without attachment purifies. The outer behavior may look identical; the inner state determines the result.

This is the practical teaching: engage fully in your duties, but hold the results loosely. Work with your whole heart, then release. This combination of full engagement and inner freedom is the essence of karma yoga.`

  // Perform your duty

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'नियतं कुरु कर्म त्वं कर्म ज्यायो ह्यकर्मणः |\nशरीरयात्रापि च ते न प्रसिद्ध्येदकर्मणः ||',
    transliteration: 'niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ\nśarīra-yātrāpi ca te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ',
    translation: 'Perform your ordained duty, for action is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of your body would not be possible through inaction.',
    commentary: `The instruction is direct: do your duty (niyataṁ karma). Action is better than inaction—at minimum, the body requires maintenance. Even the most renounced sage must eat, breathe, and move. Total inaction is impossible.

Shankaracharya notes that "ordained duty" refers to obligatory actions according to one's station and nature. These are not optional. The question is not whether to act but how to act—with attachment or without, for ego or for offering.

This verse is practical wisdom: don't use spirituality as an excuse for paralysis. Life requires engagement. The spiritual path is not about avoiding life but transforming how we participate in it. Do what needs to be done, and do it as an offering.`

  // Action as sacrifice

    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['action', 'surrender', 'detachment'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः |\nतदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्गः समाचर ||',
    transliteration: 'yajñārthāt karmaṇo\'nyatra loko\'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ\ntad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara',
    translation: 'The world is bound by action other than that performed for sacrifice. For the sake of sacrifice, O son of Kunti, perform action free from attachment.',
    commentary: `Here is the key: action performed as yajna (sacrifice/offering) does not bind. All other action creates bondage. The same deed—done for personal gain, it binds; done as offering, it liberates. The difference is not what you do but why and how.

From the Advaitic view, "yajna" means offering action to the Divine, to the larger whole. When we act for "me and mine," we strengthen ego and create karma. When we act as instruments, offering results to the Whole, the action flows through us without sticking.

"Free from attachment" (mukta-saṅgaḥ) is the operational instruction. Perform your duty, but release the outcome. This does not mean not caring—it means not clinging. Care deeply, work skillfully, then surrender results. This is the alchemy that transforms ordinary action into spiritual practice.`

  // Work for world welfare

    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'कर्मणैव हि संसिद्धिमास्थिता जनकादयः |\nलोकसंग्रहमेवापि सम्पश्यन्कर्तुमर्हसि ||',
    transliteration: 'karmaṇaiva hi saṁsiddhim āsthitā janakādayaḥ\nloka-saṅgraham evāpi sampaśyan kartum arhasi',
    translation: 'By action alone, Janaka and others attained perfection. Even considering the welfare of the world, you should act.',
    commentary: `Krishna cites King Janaka—a realized sage who continued to rule his kingdom. Perfection did not require abandoning responsibilities. Even the wise act, not for personal need but for "world welfare" (loka-sangraha)—maintaining social order and inspiring others.

Shankaracharya explains that Janaka and other ancient kings had attained Self-knowledge, yet they continued their duties. Their action was not from personal need but from compassion—showing others that action and wisdom can coexist.

This verse addresses a subtle ego: "I'm too spiritual for ordinary duties." The truly wise recognize that their visible engagement helps others. By acting rightly, they demonstrate that realization does not mean withdrawal. Leadership includes showing the way through one's own example.`

  // The wise should set an example

    transliteration: 'yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ\nsa yat pramāṇaṁ kurute lokas tad anuvartate',
    translation: 'Whatever a great person does, others follow. Whatever standard they set, the world follows.',
    commentary: `Leadership by example: people watch those they respect and imitate them. If the wise withdraw from action, ordinary people—who lack their discrimination—may do the same and fall into confusion. The leader's behavior sets a standard.

From the Advaitic view, this places responsibility on those with understanding. Having gained clarity, one cannot simply retreat. The very achievement creates obligation—not to impose views, but to demonstrate through action that right living is possible.

This verse has implications for anyone in a position of influence—parent, teacher, leader, elder. Your actions teach more than your words. If you preach detachment but act from anxiety, the contradiction undermines your message. Embody what you wish to transmit.`

  // Even Krishna acts

    sanskrit: 'न मे पार्थास्ति कर्तव्यं त्रिषु लोकेषु किञ्चन |\nनानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं वर्त एव च कर्मणि ||',
    transliteration: 'na me pārthāsti kartavyaṁ triṣu lokeṣu kiñcana\nnānavāptam avāptavyaṁ varta eva ca karmaṇi',
    translation: 'There is nothing in the three worlds, O Partha, that I need to do, nor anything to be obtained that I have not obtained—yet I engage in action.',
    commentary: `Krishna reveals his own position: the Divine has nothing to gain, nothing to accomplish—yet acts anyway. This is the purest karma yoga: action without any personal motive whatsoever, because motive has no ground when nothing is lacking.

Shankaracharya sees here the model for human action. We act because we want something; Krishna acts wanting nothing. As we approach that state—reducing personal agenda through practice—our action becomes increasingly pure, increasingly an expression of what is rather than grasping for what should be.

If the Divine acts without need, how much more should humans act? The excuse "I have no motivation" is exposed as spiritual laziness. Action can flow from fullness, not just from lack. The sage acts because it is appropriate, because life calls for response, not because they personally need the result.`

    transliteration: 'saktāḥ karmaṇy avidvāṁso yathā kurvanti bhārata\nkuryād vidvāṁs tathāsaktaś cikīrṣur loka-saṅgraham',
    translation: 'As the ignorant act with attachment, O Bharata, so should the wise act without attachment, wishing to maintain the world order.',
    commentary: `A remarkable instruction: the wise should act as energetically as the ignorant—but without attachment. The outer appearance may be similar; the inner orientation differs completely. The ignorant act from desire; the wise act from understanding, for the world's welfare.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this prevents the wise from becoming ineffective or withdrawn. Their freedom from attachment should not translate into lack of engagement. Rather, that very freedom allows them to act more effectively, without the distortions that personal agenda introduces.

"Loka-sangraha" (maintaining world order) suggests that individual realization has social implications. The realized person becomes a stabilizing force in the world—not by imposing anything, but by embodying harmony. Their action, arising from clarity, naturally serves the whole.`

  // Understanding the gunas

    transliteration: 'prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ\nahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate',
    translation: 'Actions are performed entirely by the gunas of prakriti. One whose mind is deluded by ego thinks, "I am the doer."',
    commentary: `This verse reveals the metaphysics behind karma yoga. Actions are actually performed by the gunas (qualities of nature); the Self does nothing. But the ego (ahaṅkāra) claims doership: "I am doing this." This claim is the root of bondage.

Shankaracharya explains that all activity belongs to prakriti (nature), not to the Self. The body moves, the mind thinks, the senses perceive—all prakriti. The Self is the unchanging witness. But identification with body-mind creates the illusion "I am acting."

Understanding this transforms action. When we see that "we" are not actually doing anything—that nature operates through us—the grip of doership loosens. We can then act without the burden of personal agency. The action happens; the Self remains uninvolved.`

    transliteration: 'tattva-vit tu mahā-bāho guṇa-karma-vibhāgayoḥ\nguṇā guṇeṣu vartanta iti matvā na sajjate',
    translation: 'But one who knows the truth about the divisions of gunas and actions, O mighty-armed, understanding that gunas act upon gunas, does not become attached.',
    commentary: `The knower of truth (tattva-vit) sees that "gunas act upon gunas"—senses (made of gunas) perceiving objects (made of gunas). There is no "I" doing anything; there is only nature interacting with itself. Seeing this, attachment naturally releases.

From the Advaitic view, this is liberation in action. The body continues its functions, the mind its thoughts, the person appears to act—but the wise person knows: "This is not me. I am the witness, unchanging." This knowledge is not belief but direct seeing.

When you see the mechanics clearly—stimulus, response, reaction, all nature's play—where is the "you" that could be attached? Attachment requires a sense of personal stake. When that stake is seen as illusory, attachment has no ground. The action continues, but you are no longer bound by it.`

    translation: 'The Lord said: It is desire, it is anger, born of the quality of rajas, all-devouring and most sinful. Know this to be the enemy here.',
    commentary: `Arjuna asked what compels a person to sin even against their will (3.36). Krishna answers: desire (kama) and its frustrated form, anger (krodha). These arise from rajas (the active, passionate guna) and are insatiable—"all-devouring" (mahashana). They are the true enemy.

Shankaracharya notes that desire, when obstructed, becomes anger. They are two faces of the same force. This force is "most sinful" (mahapapma) because it drives all harmful action. The person who acts wrongly is often being driven by desire or its frustration.

Identifying the enemy is the first step to freedom. We often blame circumstances, other people, fate—but the real opponent is internal. Desire and anger cloud judgment, compel action, and create suffering. Knowing this allows us to address the actual problem rather than its symptoms.`

    translation: 'As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an embryo by the womb, so is this (knowledge) covered by that (desire).',
    commentary: `Three degrees of covering: smoke over fire (thin, easily dispersed), dust on mirror (thicker, requires cleaning), womb around embryo (complete enclosure). These represent how desire obscures wisdom—slightly, moderately, or totally, depending on the individual.

From the Advaitic view, the Self is self-luminous like fire. But desire covers it, making it appear dim or hidden. For some, the covering is light and wisdom shines through easily. For others, more work is needed. For a few, the covering is so dense that wisdom seems absent.

The teaching offers hope: all three coverings can be removed. Smoke disperses with a breath, dust wipes away with effort, the embryo eventually emerges from the womb. However dense the covering of desire, it is not permanent. The fire of the Self remains unharmed beneath whatever obscures it.`

    translation: 'Thus knowing that which is higher than the intellect, and steadying the self by the Self, slay the enemy in the form of desire, O mighty-armed, which is hard to overcome.',
    commentary: `The chapter concludes with a call to action: knowing the Self that transcends intellect, stabilizing oneself in that knowledge, destroy the enemy—desire. The epithet "mighty-armed" (mahā-bāho) reminds Arjuna that he has the strength for this battle.

Shankaracharya explains "higher than intellect" as the Self (Ātman), which is beyond all mental functions. "Steadying the self by the Self" means using the higher wisdom to stabilize the lower mind. From that stability, desire can be conquered.

This verse transforms the external battle into an internal one. The real war is not on Kurukshetra but within. The enemy is not the Kauravas but desire. And the weapon is not the Gandiva bow but Self-knowledge. Win this inner battle, and the outer battle—whatever form it takes—becomes manageable.`
