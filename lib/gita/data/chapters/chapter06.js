    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nanāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ\nsa sannyāsī ca yogī ca na niragnir na cākriyaḥ',
    translation: 'The Lord said: One who performs their duty without depending on the fruits of action is both a sannyasi and a yogi—not one who merely renounces fire rituals or action.',
    commentary: `Krishna redefines renunciation: the true sannyasi is not one who gives up rituals or activities, but one who acts without attachment to results. This inner renunciation is the real thing; outer forms without inner freedom are empty.

Shankaracharya notes that this verse integrates karma yoga and sannyasa. The person who acts (karma yogi) without attachment to fruits has achieved what the formal renunciate (sannyasi) seeks. The two paths converge in the same inner attitude.

This teaching liberates us from the false choice between engagement and renunciation. You can be fully active in the world and fully free—if your action is not driven by craving for results. The fireless hermit who still craves has not renounced; the active householder who has released results is the true renunciate.`

    transliteration: 'yaṁ sannyāsam iti prāhur yogaṁ taṁ viddhi pāṇḍava\nna hy asannyasta-saṅkalpo yogī bhavati kaścana',
    translation: 'What they call renunciation, know that to be yoga, O Pandava. For no one becomes a yogi who has not renounced selfish purpose.',
    commentary: `Yoga and sannyasa are the same in essence: the giving up of sankalpa—selfish intention, personal agenda, the "what's in it for me?" Without this inner renunciation, there is no yoga, regardless of what practices one performs.

From the Advaitic standpoint, sankalpa is the root of bondage. It is the self-centered orientation that turns every action into a transaction, every relationship into a negotiation. Releasing sankalpa is releasing the calculating self—and that release is both yoga and sannyasa.

This verse defines the common ground of all spiritual paths. Whatever form practice takes—meditation, action, devotion—the essential movement is from self-centered to selfless. No genuine spiritual progress occurs without this shift. The forms vary; the essence does not.`

  // Action and stillness for different stages

    transliteration: 'ārurukṣor muner yogaṁ karma kāraṇam ucyate\nyogārūḍhasya tasyaiva śamaḥ kāraṇam ucyate',
    translation: 'For the sage who wishes to ascend to yoga, action is said to be the means. For one who has ascended to yoga, tranquility is said to be the means.',
    commentary: `Two stages, two approaches. For the aspirant still climbing toward yoga, action (karma) is the means—it purifies the mind and prepares for deeper practice. For one who has "ascended" to yoga, tranquility (shama)—peaceful abiding—becomes the means to stabilize and deepen realization.

Shankaracharya explains that this verse shows the progression of practice. First, karma yoga purifies. Then, when the mind is ready, quietude becomes primary. Trying to be still before the mind is purified leads to frustration; staying active after readiness for stillness delays progress.

This teaching addresses the question "should I be active or still?" The answer: it depends on your stage. If the mind is still restless, engage it in right action. If it has become naturally quiet, rest in that quietude. Know where you are and practice accordingly.`

    translation: 'When one is attached neither to sense objects nor to actions, having renounced all selfish purposes, then one is said to have ascended to yoga.',
    commentary: `Here are the signs of one established in yoga: no attachment to sense objects (the external pull), no attachment to actions (the doer's pride), and complete release of sankalpa (selfish intention). This is the yogarudha—one who has arrived.

From the Advaitic view, this describes the state where the usual motivations have lost their grip. The senses no longer compel pursuit; actions no longer feed ego; the constant planning for personal gain has ceased. What remains is presence, response, freedom.

This is not a state of dullness or withdrawal but of natural ease. The yogarudha may act vigorously when appropriate, enjoy sensory experience when it occurs—but neither grasps nor is grasped. They have become spacious enough to include everything without being controlled by anything.`

    transliteration: 'uddhared ātmanātmānaṁ nātmānam avasādayet\nātmaiva hy ātmano bandhur ātmaiva ripur ātmanaḥ',
    translation: 'One should elevate oneself by the self, not degrade oneself. For the self alone is the friend of the self, and the self alone is the enemy of the self.',
    commentary: `A profound psychological teaching: you are both your greatest ally and your worst enemy. No external force has the power to liberate or bind you that you yourself do not give it. Self-effort is required—no one else can do the work for you.

Shankaracharya interprets "self" here as referring to the lower self (mind-ego) being elevated by the higher Self (Atman). The mind can be trained by wisdom to become a friend on the path, or left untrained to become an obstacle.

This verse places responsibility squarely where it belongs. We often blame circumstances or others for our condition, but the deeper truth is that we create our own bondage through how we use our faculties. The same capacities that created bondage can create freedom. Choose to be your own friend.`

    translation: 'For one who has conquered the self by the self, the self is a friend. But for one who has not conquered the self, the self remains hostile like an enemy.',
    commentary: `The condition is clear: the self is your friend if you have conquered it; otherwise, it behaves as an enemy. "Conquest" here means mastery—the higher self governing the lower, wisdom directing the mind-senses rather than being dragged by them.

From the Advaitic standpoint, the unconquered mind is like a wild horse—unpredictable, potentially dangerous, working against your interests. The conquered mind is the same horse trained—now a powerful ally that takes you where you want to go.

This teaching eliminates victim mentality. If your mind is your enemy, you made it so—and you can unmake it. Through practice, discipline, and understanding, the hostile mind becomes friendly. The very force that creates suffering can become the force that ends it.`

    translation: 'The supreme Self is established in one who has conquered the self and is peaceful, remaining the same in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, honor and dishonor.',
    commentary: `For the self-conquered and peaceful person, the supreme Self (Paramatma) is "samahita"—settled, established, constant. And the sign of this: equanimity in the pairs of opposites—physical (cold/heat), emotional (pleasure/pain), social (honor/dishonor).

Shankaracharya notes that equanimity is both the sign and the fruit of Self-realization. When one knows the Self as unchanging, the changing circumstances of body, emotion, and social status no longer disturb. They are experienced but not identified with.

This verse describes what stable realization looks like in daily life. Not absence of experience—cold is still cold, pain still painful—but absence of disturbance. The experience passes through without leaving a mark. This stability indicates that the Self is known, not just conceptually but experientially.`

    translation: 'One who is equal-minded toward friends, companions, enemies, neutrals, arbiters, the hateful, relatives, the righteous and the sinful—that one excels.',
    commentary: `The supreme yogi sees with equal eye: friends and enemies, saints and sinners, those who love them and those who hate them. This does not mean treating everyone identically in behavior, but seeing the same Self in all—and not being controlled by attraction or aversion.

From the Advaitic view, this equal vision (sama-buddhi) is the natural result of knowing the Self. When you see the one consciousness in all beings, how can you hate anyone? The form-level differences remain visible, but the essence-level unity is primary.

This is the highest ethical teaching: not rules about how to treat different people, but a transformation of vision that makes discrimination impossible. The yogi does not practice equality as discipline but lives it as perception. They literally see differently.`

    sanskrit: 'योगी युञ्जीत सततमात्मानं रहसि स्थितः |\nएकाकी यतचित्तात्मा निराशीरपरिग्रहः ||',
    transliteration: 'yogī yuñjīta satatam ātmānaṁ rahasi sthitaḥ\nekākī yata-cittātmā nirāśīr aparigrahaḥ',
    translation: 'The yogi should constantly engage the mind, dwelling in solitude, alone, with mind and body controlled, free from desires and possessions.',
    commentary: `Practical instructions begin: constant practice (satatam), solitude (rahasi), aloneness (ekaki), control of mind and body (yata-cittātmā), freedom from desire (nirāśīḥ), non-possessiveness (aparigrahaḥ). These are the conditions that support deep meditation.

Shankaracharya explains that "solitude" means freedom from distractions, both external and internal. "Aloneness" is not loneliness but the willingness to face oneself without props. "Free from possessions" indicates lightness—not necessarily owning nothing, but not being owned by what one owns.

These conditions are ideals toward which the practitioner moves. Few can immediately achieve total solitude or complete desirelessness. But the direction is clear: reduce distractions, simplify needs, cultivate inner stillness. Create the conditions in which meditation can deepen.`

    translation: 'In a clean place, having established a firm seat for oneself, neither too high nor too low, with cloth, skin, and kusha grass placed there...',
    commentary: `Krishna becomes very practical: the meditation seat matters. Clean place (śucau deśe), firm seat (sthiram āsanam), proper height (neither too high nor too low), appropriate materials. These details indicate that the physical setup supports the practice.

From the traditional view, the layered seat (kusha grass, deerskin, cloth) served both practical and symbolic purposes—insulation from earth, comfort, consecration of the space. The essential point is creating conditions conducive to steady, comfortable sitting.

Modern practitioners may adapt these details while honoring the principle: your meditation environment matters. A dedicated, clean, comfortable space signals to the mind that something important is about to happen. The outer arrangement supports the inner work.`

    transliteration: 'tatraikāgraṁ manaḥ kṛtvā yata-cittendriya-kriyaḥ\nupaviśyāsane yuñjyād yogam ātma-viśuddhaye',
    translation: '...sitting there on that seat, making the mind one-pointed, with the activities of mind and senses controlled, one should practice yoga for self-purification.',
    commentary: `The purpose is clear: self-purification (ātma-viśuddhaye). The method: one-pointed mind (ekāgram manaḥ), controlled mental and sensory activity. Sit, focus, purify. This is the essence of meditation instruction.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that purification is the proximate goal. The pure mind becomes capable of Self-knowledge. Meditation does not directly produce enlightenment; it clears the obstacles that prevent recognition of what already is.

"One-pointed" is the key: gathering the scattered attention and directing it toward a single focus. What that focus is may vary (breath, mantra, inquiry), but the movement from dispersion to concentration is universal. This concentration then matures into the deeper states of meditation.`

    transliteration: 'samaṁ kāya-śiro-grīvaṁ dhārayann acalaṁ sthiraḥ\nsamprekṣya nāsikāgraṁ svaṁ diśaś cānavalokayan',
    translation: 'Holding the body, head, and neck erect, motionless and steady, gazing at the tip of the nose, not looking around...',
    commentary: `Physical details continue: spine erect (body, head, neck aligned), motionless (acalam), steady (sthiraḥ), gaze directed at the nose tip (nāsikāgram). The eyes neither closed nor wandering—a soft, settled focus that reduces external distraction.

From the yogic tradition, posture matters because body and mind are connected. A slumped posture induces dullness; an erect posture supports alertness without tension. The gaze at the nose tip collects the wandering attention and turns it inward.

These instructions are pragmatic: try sitting with spine erect versus slumped, and notice the difference in mental clarity. The ancient teachings are not arbitrary but based on careful observation of how physical conditions affect meditative states.`

    translation: '...with mind serene, fearless, established in the vow of brahmacharya, controlling the mind, thinking of Me, let the yogi sit, having Me as the supreme goal.',
    commentary: `Inner qualities now: serene (praśānta), fearless (vigata-bhīḥ), continent (brahmacāri), mind controlled, focused on the Divine (mac-citto), with the Divine as supreme goal (mat-paraḥ). The outer posture supports these inner orientations.

Shankaracharya notes that "brahmacharya" in this context means control of all senses, not just sexual continence. "Fearless" indicates freedom from anxiety about the practice or its results. "Thinking of Me" directs attention toward the ultimate.

The combination of technique and devotion is significant. This is not mere concentration exercise but loving attention toward the Divine. The mind is controlled, but the heart is engaged. Technical precision and devotional warmth unite in authentic meditation.`

    translation: 'Thus always keeping the mind engaged, the yogi of controlled mind attains peace, the supreme nirvana, which abides in Me.',
    commentary: `The promise: consistent practice (sada) with controlled mind (niyata-mānasaḥ) leads to supreme peace (śāntim), nirvana (nirvāṇa-paramām), abiding in the Divine (mat-saṁsthām). The goal is not mere tranquility but liberation itself.

From the Advaitic view, this peace is not a temporary state produced by meditation but recognition of one's true nature. The practice removes obstacles; what remains is the natural peace of the Self. It was always there, only obscured.

"Abides in Me" (mat-saṁsthām) indicates that this peace is not personal acquisition but return to source. The individual drop recognizes itself as the ocean. This is not losing oneself but finding what one truly is—which turns out to be infinite, eternal, blissful.`

    translation: 'Yoga is not for one who eats too much, nor for one who abstains too much from eating; not for one who sleeps too much, nor for one who is always awake, O Arjuna.',
    commentary: `The middle way: extremes defeat yoga. Not too much food, not too little. Not too much sleep, not too little. Balance (yukta) is the theme—the very word "yoga" contains this idea of proper joining, appropriate measure.

Shankaracharya sees this as practical wisdom. Overeating makes the body heavy and the mind dull; under-eating makes both weak. Oversleeping produces lethargy; undersleeping produces agitation. The yogi finds the mean that supports clear, energetic practice.

This teaching prevents ascetic excess. Some seekers, in their enthusiasm, push too hard—extreme fasting, minimal sleep—and burn out or damage health. Krishna counsels moderation. The body is the vehicle for practice; care for it appropriately. Yoga is sustainable engagement, not heroic suffering.`

    translation: 'For one who is moderate in eating and recreation, moderate in effort in actions, moderate in sleep and waking—yoga becomes the destroyer of suffering.',
    commentary: `Yukta (balanced, moderate) is repeated three times: in food and recreation, in effort, in sleep and waking. This rhythm of balance becomes the destroyer of suffering (duḥkha-hā). Yoga itself does the work when conditions are right.

From the Advaitic perspective, suffering arises from extremes—grasping and aversion, excess and deficiency. The middle way naturally reduces the friction that creates suffering. When life becomes balanced, the mind settles, and in that settling, yoga happens.

"Destroyer of suffering" is a beautiful epithet for yoga. Not merely reducer or manager of suffering, but destroyer. The promise is complete freedom from the deep suffering born of ignorance. Balance in daily life creates the conditions for this destruction to occur.`

    commentary: `Here is the criterion for being "yukta"—established in yoga: the mind rests in the Self alone (ātmany eva), free from longing for desires (niḥspṛhaḥ sarva-kāmebhyaḥ). Not suppressing desires but being free from the longing itself.

Shankaracharya emphasizes "in the Self alone"—not in objects, relationships, achievements, or even spiritual experiences, but in pure being. When attention naturally rests there, without needing to be somewhere else, yoga is established.

The state described is not blank or empty but full. The Self is not a void to be endured but the source of all fulfillment. When the mind discovers this, external desires lose their power—not through denial but through having found something better.`

    commentary: `A beautiful image: the steady flame in still air. No flickering, no wavering—just clear, stable light. This is the controlled mind in meditation: undisturbed by the winds of desire and distraction, burning steadily.

From the contemplative tradition, this simile captures the quality of attention being described. Most minds are like flames in wind—dancing, guttering, nearly blown out. The yogi's mind has found shelter and burns straight up, illuminating clearly.

This image can guide practice. Notice when the mind-flame flickers—what wind is blowing? External distraction? Internal craving? Memory or fantasy? Each flickering is an opportunity to notice the wind and find shelter again. Gradually, the flame stabilizes.`

    translation: 'From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, from there let him restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone.',
    commentary: `Krishna gives the practical instruction: whenever the mind wanders (yato yato niścarati), from whatever cause, restrain it (niyamya) and bring it back to the Self (ātmany eva vaśaṁ nayet). This is the core of meditation practice—not fighting the mind but gently returning it.

Shankaracharya explains that the mind wanders due to sense-objects (sound, etc.); by discerning those as mere appearances and with detachment, the yogi restrains the mind. Through repeated practice, the mind merges in the Self. The key is to complete withdrawal by consciously applying the mind at once to contemplation of the Self—not just pulling it back but redirecting it.`

    translation: 'One whose self is established in yoga sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings in the Self, seeing the same everywhere.',
    commentary: `The yogic vision: Self in all, all in Self. This is not philosophy but perception—the yoga-yukta actually sees (īkṣate) this unity. "Sama-darśana" (equal vision) is not a moral should but a natural seeing once the veil lifts.

Shankaracharya explains that this verse describes non-dual vision. The same consciousness that illumines my experience illumines all experience. Recognizing this, how can I see anyone as truly "other"? The boundaries that seemed so solid become transparent.

This vision has profound implications. If I see myself in all beings, harming them becomes impossible—it would be self-harm. If I see all beings in myself, service becomes natural—caring for them is caring for extensions of my own being. Ethics flows spontaneously from clear seeing.`

    translation: 'One who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me—to that one I am never lost, nor is that one ever lost to Me.',
    commentary: `The relationship becomes unbreakable: for one who sees Krishna everywhere and everything in Krishna, mutual presence is eternal. "I am never lost to them; they are never lost to Me." This is the covenant of yoga—permanent connection.

From the Advaitic view, this is not two beings maintaining contact but recognition of non-separation. The Divine and the devotee who sees truly are not two things that might lose each other; they are one reality that cannot be divided.

For the devotee, this is immense comfort. You cannot lose God; God cannot lose you. Whatever happens in the play of life and death, the essential connection is unbroken because there is no real distance to begin with. Seeing clearly reveals what was always so.`

    commentary: `Through "Self-likeness" (ātmaupamyena)—seeing others as oneself—one sees equality (samaṁ) everywhere, in joy and sorrow. Such a person is the highest yogi (paramo yogī). Shankaracharya says this is applying the same standard to all: as happiness is dear to me, so to all; as sorrow is unwelcome to me, so to all. The yogi who is non-injurious and steadfast in illumination is the best.`

  // Arjuna's doubt about the restless mind

    transliteration: 'arjuna uvāca\nyo\'yaṁ yogas tvayā proktaḥ sāmyena madhusūdana\netasyāhaṁ na paśyāmi cañcalatvāt sthitiṁ sthirām',
    translation: 'Arjuna said: This yoga of equanimity which you have taught, O Madhusudana—I do not see how it can be steady, because of restlessness.',
    commentary: `Arjuna speaks for every meditator: "This sounds beautiful, but my mind won't cooperate!" The teaching describes equanimity; the experience is restlessness (cañcalatva). How can the steady state (sthitiṁ sthirām) be achieved when the mind is so unstable?

This honest objection is valuable. Arjuna does not pretend to understand or to have already achieved. He voices the actual difficulty, creating space for Krishna to address the real obstacle—the restless nature of mind itself.

Anyone who has tried to meditate knows this problem. The instructions seem simple: just be still, just focus, just rest. But the mind has other plans. Arjuna's question legitimizes the struggle and invites a response that takes human limitation seriously.`

    translation: 'For the mind is restless, O Krishna, turbulent, powerful, and obstinate. I think it is as hard to control as the wind.',
    commentary: `Arjuna intensifies: the mind is not merely restless but turbulent (pramāthi), powerful (balavat), obstinate (dṛḍham). Controlling it seems as impossible as controlling the wind. This is felt experience, not theory—the raw truth of trying to meditate.

From the practical standpoint, Arjuna is right. The mind is incredibly difficult to control through direct effort. Anyone who has tried to simply stop thinking knows the futility. The harder you try, the more thoughts multiply.

This comparison to wind is apt. Wind goes where it will; you cannot grab it or force it. Yet wind can be worked with—sails can be set, windmills can turn. Perhaps the mind is similar: not to be controlled by force but redirected, harnessed, gradually trained. Krishna's answer will address this.`

    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nasaṁśayaṁ mahā-bāho mano durnigrahaṁ calam\nabhyāsena tu kaunteya vairāgyeṇa ca gṛhyate',
    translation: 'The Lord said: Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed one, the mind is restless and hard to control. But by practice and dispassion, O son of Kunti, it can be restrained.',
    commentary: `Krishna agrees with the difficulty but offers hope: "undoubtedly" (asaṁśayam) the mind is hard to control, "but" (tu) it can be done through two means—practice (abhyāsa) and dispassion (vairāgya). The balance of these two is the key.

Shankaracharya explains abhyāsa as repeated effort to fix the mind on its object, and vairāgya as freedom from craving for sensory pleasures. Practice without dispassion gets undermined by desires; dispassion without practice has no direction. Together, they work.

This is the classical yoga formula, also found in Patanjali's Sutras (1.12). It is encouraging: the restless mind is not a flaw unique to you but the nature of mind. And nature can be worked with. Consistent practice and letting go of what pulls attention away—over time, this combination succeeds.`

    translation: 'Yoga is difficult to attain for one of uncontrolled mind—this is My view. But by one of controlled mind who strives, it can be attained by proper means.',
    commentary: `Krishna acknowledges the reality: for the uncontrolled mind (asaṁyatātmanā), yoga is indeed hard to attain. But—and this is the key—for the controlled mind (vaśyātmanā) that strives with proper means (upāyataḥ), it can be done. The means exist; effort is required.

From the teaching standpoint, this is balanced encouragement. Not false promises ("it's easy!") nor discouragement ("it's impossible!"). The truth: difficult, but achievable through right method and sustained effort.

"Proper means" (upāyataḥ) is significant. Not any effort will do; the means must be appropriate. Wrong methods waste time and may cause harm. This is why teaching and guidance matter—to learn the proper means that actually lead to the goal.`
