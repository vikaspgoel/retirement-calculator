    sanskrit: 'श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nअभयं सत्त्वसंशुद्धिर्ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थितिः |\nदानं दमश्च यज्ञश्च स्वाध्यायस्तप आर्जवम् ||',
    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nabhayaṁ sattva-saṁśuddhir jñāna-yoga-vyavasthitiḥ\ndānaṁ damaś ca yajñaś ca svādhyāyas tapa ārjavam',
    translation: 'The Lord said: Fearlessness, purity of mind, steadfastness in knowledge and yoga, charity, self-control, sacrifice, study of scriptures, austerity, and straightforwardness...',
    commentary: `Krishna begins listing divine (daivi) qualities. First: fearlessness (abhaya)—the foundational quality. Then purity of mind (sattva-saṁśuddhi), commitment to knowledge and yoga, charity (dāna), self-control, sacrifice, study, austerity, and straightforwardness (ārjava).

Fearlessness heads the list because fear is the root of much dysfunction. The anxious mind cannot be pure; the frightened heart cannot be generous. Freedom from fear enables all other virtues.

"Steadfastness in knowledge and yoga" combines understanding and practice. Neither alone suffices; theory without practice is sterile, practice without understanding is blind. Divine nature includes both.`

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['equanimity', 'peace'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'अहिंसा सत्यमक्रोधस्त्यागः शान्तिरपैशुनम् |\nदया भूतेष्वलोलुप्त्वं मार्दवं ह्रीरचापलम् ||',
    transliteration: 'ahiṁsā satyam akrodhas tyāgaḥ śāntir apaiśunam\ndayā bhūteṣv aloluptvaṁ mārdavaṁ hrīr acāpalam',
    translation: '...non-violence, truthfulness, freedom from anger, renunciation, peacefulness, absence of slander, compassion to beings, non-covetousness, gentleness, modesty, absence of fickleness...',
    commentary: `The list continues: ahiṁsā (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), akrodha (freedom from anger), tyāga (renunciation), śānti (peace), apaiśuna (not slandering), dayā (compassion), aloluptva (non-greed), mārdava (gentleness), hrī (modesty), acāpala (steadiness).

These qualities interrelate. Non-violence and compassion support each other. Freedom from anger enables peace. Truthfulness requires courage. Together, they form a constellation of virtue.

"Absence of fickleness" (acāpala) suggests stability of purpose. The divine nature is not blown about by every wind; it holds course. This stability comes from inner clarity and conviction.`

    verse: 3,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3'],
    themes: ['courage', 'faith'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'तेजः क्षमा धृतिः शौचमद्रोहो नातिमानिता |\nभवन्ति सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातस्य भारत ||',
    transliteration: 'tejaḥ kṣamā dhṛtiḥ śaucam adroho nāti-mānitā\nbhavanti sampadaṁ daivīm abhijātasya bhārata',
    translation: '...vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of hatred, absence of excessive pride—these belong to one born of divine nature, O Bharata.',
    commentary: `Completing the divine list: vigor (tejas), forgiveness (kṣamā), fortitude (dhṛti), purity (śauca), non-hatred (adroha), and humility (nāti-mānitā). "These belong to one born of divine nature" (sampadaṁ daivīm).

The list balances strength and softness. Vigor and fortitude are strong; forgiveness and humility are soft. Divine nature is not weak—it has tejas (brilliance, energy)—but its strength serves virtue, not ego.

"Absence of excessive pride" (nāti-mānitā) is nuanced. Some self-respect is healthy; excessive pride is demonic. The divine person knows their worth without inflation or deflation.`

  // Demonic qualities

    chapter: 16,
    verse: 4,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q1'],
    themes: ['ignorance', 'desire'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'दम्भो दर्पोऽभिमानश्च क्रोधः पारुष्यमेव च |\nअज्ञानं चाभिजातस्य पार्थ सम्पदमासुरीम् ||',
    transliteration: 'dambho darpo\'bhimānaś ca krodhaḥ pāruṣyam eva ca\najñānaṁ cābhijātasya pārtha sampadam āsurīm',
    translation: 'Ostentation, arrogance, excessive pride, anger, harshness, and ignorance—these belong to one born of demonic nature, O Partha.',
    commentary: `The demonic (āsuri) qualities: dambha (ostentation/hypocrisy), darpa (arrogance), abhimāna (excessive pride), krodha (anger), pāruṣya (harshness), and ajñāna (ignorance). These form the demonic constellation.

Notice how concise this list is compared to the divine. Evil is simpler than good; destruction is easier than construction. A few poisons can ruin what many virtues build.

"Ignorance" (ajñāna) is particularly significant—it underlies all the others. The ignorant person doesn't know themselves, doesn't know reality, doesn't know consequences. From this darkness, all other faults arise.`

  // Divine leads to liberation
  {
    id: 'bg-16-5',
    chapter: 16,
    verse: 5,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['hope', 'peace'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'दैवी सम्पद्विमोक्षाय निबन्धायासुरी मता |\nमा शुचः सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव ||',
    transliteration: 'daivī sampad vimokṣāya nibandhāyāsurī matā\nmā śucaḥ sampadaṁ daivīm abhijāto\'si pāṇḍava',
    translation: 'Divine nature leads to liberation; demonic to bondage. Do not grieve, O Pandava—you are born of divine nature.',
    commentary: `The destinies diverge: divine nature (daivī sampad) leads to liberation (vimokṣāya); demonic nature leads to bondage (nibandhāya). Then Krishna consoles Arjuna: "Do not grieve—you are born of divine nature."

This personal assurance is important. Arjuna might worry: do I have demonic tendencies? Krishna confirms: no, you are divine. This confidence supports practice; doubt undermines it.

The teaching also implies choice. Though the verse says "born of," the qualities can be cultivated. Divine nature grows through practice; demonic through neglect. We are not fated but inclined—and inclination can change.`

  // The demonic mindset described

    id: 'bg-16-7',
    chapter: 16,
    verse: 7,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q1'],
    themes: ['ignorance'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च जना न विदुरासुराः |\nन शौचं नापि चाचारो न सत्यं तेषु विद्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca janā na vidur āsurāḥ\nna śaucaṁ nāpi cācāro na satyaṁ teṣu vidyate',
    translation: 'The demonic do not know what to do or what to avoid. Neither purity, nor right conduct, nor truth is found in them.',
    commentary: `The demonic lack discrimination: they don't know pravṛtti (what to do) or nivṛtti (what to avoid). They have no purity (śauca), no proper conduct (ācāra), no truth (satya). Complete moral confusion.

"Do not know" (na vidur) indicates ignorance, not malice. The demonic are confused, not consciously evil. They genuinely don't see the difference between right and wrong. This makes their condition tragic as well as dangerous.

This verse helps understand moral blindness. Some people aren't being deliberately bad; they literally don't perceive the moral dimension. Purity, conduct, and truth are invisible to them. This is the fruit of tamas combined with ego.`

  // The demonic worldview
  {
    id: 'bg-16-8',
    chapter: 16,
    verse: 8,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q1'],
    themes: ['ignorance'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'असत्यमप्रतिष्ठं ते जगदाहुरनीश्वरम् |\nअपरस्परसम्भूतं किमन्यत्कामहैतुकम् ||',
    transliteration: 'asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te jagad āhur anīśvaram\napara-spara-sambhūtaṁ kim anyat kāma-haitukam',
    translation: 'They say: "The world is without truth, without foundation, without God, produced by mutual union, caused by desire alone—what else?"',
    commentary: `The demonic worldview: the world is asatya (without truth/reality), apratiṣṭha (without foundation), anīśvara (without God). It arises from random combination (aparaspara-sambhūta), driven only by desire (kāma-haituka).

This is philosophical materialism: no meaning, no purpose, no divinity. Just atoms colliding, organisms reproducing, desire driving everything. "What else?" dismisses any other explanation.

Krishna is not refuting this view philosophically but showing its fruits. Those who believe this act accordingly—without moral restraint, without hope, without reverence. The worldview produces the character.`

  // Consequences of demonic view
  {
    id: 'bg-16-9',
    chapter: 16,
    verse: 9,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q1'],
    themes: ['ignorance', 'desire'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'एतां दृष्टिमवष्टभ्य नष्टात्मानोऽल्पबुद्धयः |\nप्रभवन्त्युग्रकर्माणः क्षयाय जगतोऽहिताः ||',
    transliteration: 'etāṁ dṛṣṭim avaṣṭabhya naṣṭātmāno\'lpa-buddhayaḥ\nprabhavanty ugra-karmāṇaḥ kṣayāya jagato\'hitāḥ',
    translation: 'Holding this view, these lost souls of small intelligence come forth as enemies of the world, doing cruel deeds for its destruction.',
    commentary: `The fruits of demonic worldview: "lost souls" (naṣṭātmāna—destroyed selves), "small intelligence" (alpa-buddhaya), "cruel deeds" (ugra-karmāṇa), enemies of the world (jagato'hitāḥ), working toward destruction (kṣayāya).

Without meaning, why be moral? Without God, who judges? Without truth, why restrain desire? The logical consequences of materialist nihilism are played out in behavior. Ideas have consequences.

"Enemies of the world" is strong language. The demonic person harms not just individuals but the world itself—the cosmic order, the web of life, the possibility of flourishing. Their destruction spreads.`

  // Three gates to hell
  {
    id: 'bg-16-21',
    chapter: 16,
    verse: 21,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q1'],
    themes: ['desire', 'anger', 'ignorance'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'त्रिविधं नरकस्येदं द्वारं नाशनमात्मनः |\nकामः क्रोधस्तथा लोभस्तस्मादेतत्त्रयं त्यजेत् ||',
    transliteration: 'tri-vidhaṁ narakasyedaṁ dvāraṁ nāśanam ātmanaḥ\nkāmaḥ krodhas tathā lobhas tasmād etat trayaṁ tyajet',
    translation: 'The threefold gate of hell, destructive of the self, is lust, anger, and greed. Therefore one should abandon these three.',
    commentary: `The famous "three gates to hell": kāma (lust/desire), krodha (anger), and lobha (greed). These three are "destructive of the self" (nāśanam ātmanaḥ). Therefore, abandon them (tyajet).

These three interrelate: desire, when frustrated, becomes anger; anger seeks to possess, becoming greed; greed demands satisfaction, intensifying desire. They form a reinforcing cycle that drags one downward.

"Gates to hell" is metaphor for self-destruction. These are not minor faults but fundamental errors that, unchecked, ruin a life. Recognizing them as the enemy is half the battle.`

  // Liberation from these gates
  {
    id: 'bg-16-22',
    chapter: 16,
    verse: 22,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['hope', 'peace'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'एतैर्विमुक्तः कौन्तेय तमोद्वारैस्त्रिभिर्नरः |\nआचरत्यात्मनः श्रेयस्ततो याति परां गतिम् ||',
    transliteration: 'etair vimuktaḥ kaunteya tamo-dvārais tribhir naraḥ\nācaraty ātmanaḥ śreyas tato yāti parāṁ gatim',
    translation: 'Freed from these three gates of darkness, O son of Kunti, a person practices what is good for the self and thus goes to the supreme goal.',
    commentary: `The positive promise: freed from the three gates (lust, anger, greed), one practices good (śreyas) and attains the supreme goal (parāṁ gatim). Liberation from the three enables liberation itself.

"Gates of darkness" (tamo-dvārais) links them to tamas—the guna of ignorance and delusion. These are not just moral failings but symptoms of spiritual darkness. Overcoming them is enlightenment in action.

The path is clear: abandon the three, practice the good, reach the goal. This is not mysterious or complex—difficult, yes, but comprehensible. The chapter ends with practical hope.`

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः |\nन स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम् ||',
    transliteration: 'yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ\nna sa siddhim avāpnoti na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim',
    translation: 'One who, discarding the ordinance of scripture, acts from desire alone attains neither perfection nor happiness nor the supreme goal.',
    commentary: `Whoever ignores scriptural guidance and acts only from desire (kāma-kārataḥ) attains neither siddhi, nor happiness, nor the supreme goal. Shankaracharya: scripture is the authority for what to do; abandoning it leads to confusion and bondage.`
  },

  // Follow scripture
  {
    id: 'bg-16-24',
    chapter: 16,
    verse: 24,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3'],
    themes: ['duty', 'faith'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'तस्माच्छास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते कार्याकार्यव्यवस्थितौ |\nज्ञात्वा शास्त्रविधानोक्तं कर्म कर्तुमिहार्हसि ||',
    transliteration: 'tasmāc chāstraṁ pramāṇaṁ te kāryākārya-vyavasthitau\njñātvā śāstra-vidhānoktaṁ karma kartum ihārhasi',
    translation: 'Therefore let scripture be your authority in determining what should be done and what should not be done. Knowing what is declared in scriptural ordinances, you should act here.',
    commentary: `The chapter concludes: let scripture (śāstra) be your guide in knowing what to do (kārya) and what not to do (akārya). Following scriptural guidance, act accordingly.

This is not blind fundamentalism but recognition that human judgment, especially the demonic kind, is unreliable. Scripture represents accumulated wisdom, the distilled experience of the wise. Using it as a reference protects against delusion.

"You should act" (kartum arhasi) confirms that the goal is action, not passive study. Scripture is not for academic interest but for guidance in living. Know it, then do what it says. This completes the chapter on divine and demonic natures.`
