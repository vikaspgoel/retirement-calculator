    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nimaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam\nvivasvān manave prāha manur ikṣvākave\'bravīt',
    translation: 'The Lord said: I taught this imperishable yoga to Vivasvan (the sun god); Vivasvan taught it to Manu; Manu told it to Ikshvaku.',
    commentary: `Krishna reveals the ancient lineage of this teaching: He taught it first to the sun god, who passed it to Manu (progenitor of humanity), who gave it to King Ikshvaku. This yoga is "imperishable" (avyaya)—eternal truth, not new invention.

From the traditional view, this establishes the teaching's authority. It is not Krishna's personal opinion but sanātana dharma—the eternal way. The wisdom passed through divine and royal lineages, preserved for humanity's benefit.

By mentioning the sun god, Krishna hints at His own cosmic nature. He was present at the beginning, teaching even the celestials. This sets up Arjuna's question in verse 4: how could Krishna, seemingly born recently, have taught at the beginning of creation?`

    sanskrit: 'यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत |\nअभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ||',
    transliteration: 'yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata\nabhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham',
    translation: 'Whenever dharma declines and adharma rises, O Bharata, then I create Myself.',
    commentary: `The famous promise of divine incarnation: whenever righteousness (dharma) declines and unrighteousness (adharma) rises, Krishna manifests. The phrase "yadā yadā" (whenever, whenever) indicates this is not a one-time event but a cosmic pattern.

Shankaracharya explains that the Lord's "creation" of Himself (ātmānaṁ sṛjāmi) is not ordinary birth. The Divine appears to be born through māyā but is never actually limited. Like an actor donning a costume, Krishna takes form without being constrained by it.

This verse offers profound comfort: we are not abandoned. When things seem darkest, when adharma appears triumphant, the Divine responds. History is not blind process but guided by a presence that cares enough to intervene.`

    themes: ['hope', 'courage', 'peace'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् |\nधर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे ||',
    transliteration: 'paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām\ndharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge',
    translation: 'For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of dharma, I am born in age after age.',
    commentary: `Three purposes of divine incarnation: protecting the righteous (sādhūnām), destroying the wicked (duṣkṛtām), and establishing dharma. "Age after age" (yuge yuge) indicates recurring cycles—the Divine appears whenever needed, in whatever form is appropriate.

From the bhakti perspective, "protection of the good" is personal divine care. The devotee is not alone against hostile forces; the Lord Himself comes to protect. This is not abstract providence but active intervention.

"Destruction of the wicked" raises questions for modern readers. Shankaracharya explains that the real "destruction" is of wickedness, not necessarily of the wicked person. The evildoer can be transformed or, if incorrigible, removed. The goal is dharma's establishment, not punishment for its own sake.`

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'जन्म कर्म च मे दिव्यमेवं यो वेत्ति तत्त्वतः |\nत्यक्त्वा देहं पुनर्जन्म नैति मामेति सोऽर्जुन ||',
    transliteration: 'janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ\ntyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so\'rjuna',
    translation: 'One who truly knows My divine birth and action, on leaving the body, is not reborn but comes to Me, O Arjuna.',
    commentary: `A remarkable promise: truly understanding (tattvataḥ) Krishna's divine birth and action liberates. Such a person, at death, does not take rebirth but goes to Krishna. Knowledge of the Divine's nature is itself salvific.

Shankaracharya emphasizes "truly" (tattvataḥ)—not mere intellectual acceptance but direct recognition. To know that Krishna's birth is not ordinary birth, that His action is not karma-producing action, is to understand the nature of consciousness itself.

This verse implies that Krishna's incarnation is a teaching. By appearing to be born while remaining unborn, by acting while remaining actionless, He demonstrates what is possible for the liberated. Understanding His example deeply transforms one's own relationship with birth, death, and action.`

  // Many have attained through knowledge
  {
    id: 'bg-4-10',
    chapter: 4,
    verse: 10,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'peace'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'वीतरागभयक्रोधा मन्मया मामुपाश्रिताः |\nबहवो ज्ञानतपसा पूता मद्भावमागताः ||',
    transliteration: 'vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā man-mayā mām upāśritāḥ\nbahavo jñāna-tapasā pūtā mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ',
    translation: 'Free from attachment, fear, and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the fire of knowledge—many have attained My state.',
    commentary: `Krishna offers evidence: many (bahavaḥ) have already attained liberation through this path. They became free from attachment (rāga), fear (bhaya), and anger (krodha); they were absorbed in Him (man-mayā) and took refuge (upāśritāḥ); they were purified by knowledge-fire (jñāna-tapas).

This verse is encouraging: the path works. It's not theoretical but proven by many practitioners. Liberation is not impossible or reserved for special beings; ordinary people have attained it through knowledge and devotion.

The purifying agents are interesting: not ritual but jñāna-tapas, the austerity of knowledge. The fire of wisdom burns away impurities more effectively than external observances. When understanding deepens, attachment, fear, and anger naturally fall away.`

  // All paths lead to Krishna

    sanskrit: 'ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम् |\nमम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः ||',
    transliteration: 'ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham\nmama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ',
    translation: 'In whatever way people approach Me, in that same way I reward them. All humans follow My path in every way, O Partha.',
    commentary: `A profound statement of divine responsiveness: "As they approach Me, so I respond." Krishna meets seekers where they are, in the form and manner of their approach. This is divine accommodation, not arbitrary favoritism.

Shankaracharya interprets this as explaining why different people worship different forms with different results. The variety is in approach, not in the ultimate reality. All paths, being directed toward the Divine, are actually paths to Krishna—whether the seeker knows it or not.

"All humans follow My path" (mama vartma) is striking. Even those who seem to pursue other goals are, ultimately, seeking the Divine (though perhaps unknowingly). The desire for pleasure, for security, for meaning—all are misdirected longings for what only the Divine truly provides.`

  // Fourfold order and the non-doer
  {
    id: 'bg-4-13',
    chapter: 4,
    verse: 13,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'action'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः |\nतस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम् ||',
    transliteration: 'cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ\ntasya kartāram api māṁ viddhy akartāram avyayam',
    translation: 'The fourfold order was created by Me according to the division of qualities and actions. Though I am its creator, know Me as the non-doer and immutable.',
    commentary: `Krishna explains that the fourfold social order (cātur-varṇyam) is created by Him according to guṇa (nature) and karma (action), not birth alone. Yet though He is the "creator" of this order, He is to be known as the non-doer (akartāram) and unchanging (avyayam).

Shankaracharya clarifies that the Lord is not bound by the order He creates; He acts without attachment. This verse addresses the concern that the Lord might be partial—He is the source of differentiation but remains above it, the witness who does not get entangled in the fruits of action.`

  // Action in inaction

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः |\nस बुद्धिमान्मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत् ||',
    transliteration: 'karmaṇy akarma yaḥ paśyed akarmaṇi ca karma yaḥ\nsa buddhimān manuṣyeṣu sa yuktaḥ kṛtsna-karma-kṛt',
    translation: 'One who sees inaction in action and action in inaction—that one is wise among humans, that one is a yogi, having accomplished all action.',
    commentary: `A famous paradox: seeing inaction in action and action in inaction. The wise see that the Self does nothing even when the body acts; and they see that ego-inaction (lazy withdrawal) is actually karmic action. True actionlessness is Self-knowledge, not physical stillness.

Shankaracharya unpacks: "inaction in action" means seeing that the Ātman is not the doer even when the body-mind acts. "Action in inaction" means recognizing that outward withdrawal, if done by ego for results, is still karma. The key is understanding, not physical behavior.

This verse liberates from the false dichotomy of action versus renunciation. The yogi can be intensely active while remaining inwardly still, or can be outwardly still while caught in mental karma. The distinction is subtler than behavior—it's about the sense of doership.`

  // One who has renounced fruit performs no binding action

    verse: 20,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',

    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'detachment'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रयः |\nकर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किञ्चित्करोति सः ||',
    transliteration: 'tyaktvā karma-phalāsaṅgaṁ nitya-tṛpto nirāśrayaḥ\nkarmaṇy abhipravṛtto \'pi naiva kiñcit karoti saḥ',
    translation: 'Having abandoned attachment to the fruits of action, ever content, without dependence, though engaged in action, he does nothing at all.',
    commentary: `One who has renounced attachment to results (karma-phalāsaṅgam), who is ever satisfied (nitya-tṛptaḥ) and without dependence (nirāśrayaḥ), though fully engaged in action, "does nothing" in the sense that no binding karma is created. The same action that would bind the attached person leaves the wise one free.

Shankaracharya explains that such a person acts from fullness, not want. Because there is no craving for results, the action does not create new bondage. This is the essence of karma yoga: full engagement with zero clinging.`

  // The fire of knowledge burns all karma
  {
    id: 'bg-4-19',

    verse: 19,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'detachment'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'यस्य सर्वे समारम्भाः कामसंकल्पवर्जिताः |\nज्ञानाग्निदग्धकर्माणं तमाहुः पण्डितं बुधाः ||',
    transliteration: 'yasya sarve samārambhāḥ kāma-saṅkalpa-varjitāḥ\njñānāgni-dagdha-karmāṇaṁ tam āhuḥ paṇḍitaṁ budhāḥ',
    translation: 'One whose undertakings are all free from desire and selfish motive, whose karma is burned in the fire of knowledge—that one the wise call a sage.',
    commentary: `The sage described: all actions (samārambhāḥ) are free from desire (kāma) and selfish motive (saṅkalpa). The karma that might bind has been burned by knowledge-fire (jñānāgni). The wise recognize such a one as truly learned (paṇḍita).

From the Advaitic view, "burned karma" means karma that produces no further result. When knowledge is complete, even ongoing action does not create new bondage. The fire of wisdom destroys both accumulated and future karma by eliminating the sense of doership that makes karma bind.

This is the karma yogi's destination: acting without the motivational structure that makes action bind. Not suppressing desire through willpower but seeing through it through understanding. The sage acts; karma does not stick.`

  // Action for sacrifice dissolves all karma

    transliteration: 'gata-saṅgasya muktasya jñānāvasthita-cetasaḥ\nyajñāyācarataḥ karma samagraṁ pravilīyate',
    translation: 'For one who is free from attachment, liberated, with mind established in knowledge, performing action for the sake of sacrifice—all karma is dissolved.',
    commentary: `When one is free from attachment (gata-saṅgasya), liberated (muktasya), with mind fixed in knowledge (jñānāvasthita-cetasaḥ), and performs action only as sacrifice (yajñāyācarataḥ), all karma is dissolved (samagraṁ pravilīyate). Action done as offering, with knowledge of the Self, does not bind.

Shankaracharya explains that the fire of knowledge burns the seeds of karma. Such a person may appear to act like others, but inwardly the sense of doership is gone; action flows as worship, and all binding impressions are dissolved.`

    transliteration: 'śreyān dravya-mayād yajñāj jñāna-yajñaḥ parantapa\nsarvaṁ karmākhilaṁ pārtha jñāne parisamāpyate',
    translation: 'Superior to sacrifice with material offerings is the sacrifice of knowledge, O Parantapa. All action in its entirety, O Partha, culminates in knowledge.',
    commentary: `The sacrifice of knowledge (jñāna-yajñaḥ) is greater than sacrifice performed with material things (dravya-mayāt yajñāt). All action, in the end, finds its fulfilment in knowledge. Rituals purify and prepare the mind; knowledge liberates.

Shankaracharya states that all karmas—ritual, ethical, devotional—converge in jñāna. Knowledge is the crown; once the Self is known, the need for binding action ceases.`

    transliteration: 'tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā\nupadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ',
    translation: 'Know that by prostration, by inquiry, and by service; the wise who have seen the truth will instruct you in that knowledge.',
    commentary: `Knowledge is received through three means: praṇipāta (humble prostration), paripraśna (sincere questioning), and sevā (service). The knowers of truth (tattva-darśinaḥ) will then impart knowledge. This is the traditional guru–śiṣya relationship.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that without humility and readiness to learn, even the best teaching cannot enter. The disciple’s attitude—reverence, curiosity, and service—prepares the mind to receive.`

    translation: 'Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners, you shall cross over all sin by the raft of knowledge.',
    commentary: `A powerful assurance: however great one’s past wrongs, the raft of knowledge (jñāna-plavena) can carry one across all sin (vṛjinaṁ). Knowledge here is Self-knowledge; it removes the ignorance that is the root of bondage.

Shankaracharya explains that knowledge burns the seeds of karma. No one is beyond redemption; the turn to wisdom can transform even the worst past.`

    translation: 'As a blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all karma to ashes.',
    commentary: `A powerful simile: knowledge burns karma as fire burns wood. Just as fire is indifferent to the type of wood—all becomes ash—so knowledge destroys all karma, regardless of type. Nothing survives the blaze of true understanding.

Shankaracharya emphasizes "all karma" (sarva-karmāṇi)—good and bad, past and present. Knowledge does not selectively burn some karma while preserving others; it destroys the very mechanism by which karma binds. The sense of doership, once seen through, cannot continue to accumulate results.

This offers hope to those burdened by past actions. No matter what you have done, knowledge can liberate. The fire does not ask about the wood's history; it simply burns. Similarly, wisdom doesn't negotiate with karma; it transcends the whole system.`

    translation: 'There is nothing on earth as purifying as knowledge. One who is perfected in yoga finds it in time within oneself.',
    commentary: `Knowledge is the supreme purifier—nothing equals it. And remarkably, the yoga-perfected person finds it spontaneously, within themselves, in time. It is not imported from outside but discovered as one's own nature.

Shankaracharya sees this as the culmination of the chapter's argument. Rituals purify partially, temporarily; knowledge purifies completely, permanently. Other purifiers remove specific impurities; knowledge removes the root of all impurity—ignorance of the Self.

"Finds it within" (ātmani vindati) indicates that knowledge is not acquisition but recognition. The Self is already pure; ignorance merely veiled it. Yoga removes the veil; knowledge shines forth as what was always there. This is not learning but remembering one's true nature.`

    commentary: `The one with faith (śraddhāvān), intent on that (tat-paraḥ), and with controlled senses (saṁyatendriyaḥ) gains knowledge. Having gained it, one soon reaches the highest peace (parāṁ śāntim). Faith, focus, and discipline prepare the mind; knowledge then brings peace.

Shankaracharya notes that śraddhā is trust in the teaching and the teacher; without it, the mind remains closed. With it, and with sense-control, knowledge arises and peace follows.`

    translation: 'The ignorant, the faithless, and the doubting self perish. For the doubter there is neither this world nor the next, nor happiness.',
    commentary: `A stark warning: three types are destroyed—the ignorant (ajña), the faithless (aśraddadhāna), and especially the doubter (saṁśayātmā). For the chronic doubter, neither worldly success nor spiritual progress is possible. Even happiness is lost.

Shankaracharya distinguishes productive inquiry from destructive doubt. Inquiry says "I don't yet understand; let me investigate." Doubt says "Nothing can be true; why bother?" The first leads to knowledge; the second paralyzes.

The doubter loses both worlds: unable to commit to worldly pursuits (perhaps they're meaningless) yet unable to pursue the spiritual (perhaps it's delusion). Suspended between, they have neither. The cure is not suppressed doubt but resolved doubt—inquiry that reaches conclusion.`

    translation: 'Therefore, with the sword of knowledge of the Self, cut this doubt born of ignorance dwelling in your heart. Take refuge in yoga. Arise, O Bharata!',
    commentary: `The chapter concludes with a call to action: "Arise!" (uttiṣṭha). The sword is knowledge of Self; the enemy is doubt born of ignorance; the refuge is yoga. Cut doubt, take up practice, stand up and fight.

Shankaracharya notes that doubt "dwells in the heart" (hṛt-stham)—it's not merely intellectual but emotionally rooted. The doubt that paralyzes is felt, not just thought. Therefore the weapon must penetrate to the heart: Self-knowledge that transforms one's entire being.

"Arise" echoes the Gita's practical orientation. Knowledge is not for contemplation only but for action. Having understood, act. The spiritual life is not paralysis by profundity but empowerment through understanding. Know the Self, transcend doubt, and live accordingly.`
