    transliteration: 'dhṛtarāṣṭra uvāca\ndharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ\nmāmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva kim akurvata sañjaya',
    translation: 'Dhritarashtra said: What did my sons and the sons of Pandu do when they assembled together on the sacred plain of Kurukshetra, eager for battle, O Sanjaya?',
    commentary: `The Gita opens not with wisdom but with anxiety. Dhritarashtra, blind king and father to the Kauravas, cannot see the battle—but his question betrays the deeper blindness of attachment. His phrase "my sons" (māmakāḥ) reveals the possessiveness that clouds judgment.

From the Advaitic view, Shankaracharya notes that Dhritarashtra's very question contains his fear. He asks what "happened" as though the outcome is uncertain, yet his heart already knows: dharma-kṣetra, the field of righteousness, cannot favor unrighteousness. The blind king senses this.

This opening teaches that our questions often contain our anxieties. The mind that asks "what will happen?" is already troubled. Before any answer comes, we might first observe the questioner—and recognize ourselves in Dhritarashtra's worried inquiry.`

    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'अर्जुन उवाच |\nदृष्ट्वेमं स्वजनं कृष्ण युयुत्सुं समुपस्थितम् |\nसीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति ||',
    transliteration: 'arjuna uvāca\ndṛṣṭvemaṁ sva-janaṁ kṛṣṇa yuyutsuṁ samupasthitam\nsīdanti mama gātrāṇi mukhaṁ ca pariśuṣyati',
    translation: 'Arjuna said: Seeing my own kinsmen, O Krishna, arrayed and eager for battle, my limbs fail and my mouth is parched.',
    commentary: `Arjuna's body speaks before his mind can reason. The warrior whose arms never trembled now finds his limbs failing. This is not cowardice—it is the body's honest response to an impossible situation. The physical symptoms are real: parched mouth, weakening limbs.

Shankaracharya observes that these symptoms arise from identification with relationships. "My kinsmen" (sva-janam)—the possessive pronoun reveals attachment. The Self, which witnesses all states, neither trembles nor thirsts. But the embodied self, caught in the web of roles and bonds, experiences this paralysis as utterly real.

When the body revolts against what the mind has planned, pause. Arjuna's trembling is not failure but honesty. Sometimes wisdom begins when our certainties collapse and we can no longer pretend that difficult choices are simple.`

    transliteration: 'vepathuś ca śarīre me roma-harṣaś ca jāyate\ngāṇḍīvaṁ sraṁsate hastāt tvak caiva paridahyate',
    translation: 'A tremor comes upon my body and my hairs stand on end. The Gandiva bow slips from my hand and my skin burns all over.',
    commentary: `The symptoms intensify. Arjuna's legendary bow Gandiva—the weapon that never failed him—now slips from fingers that have lost their grip. His skin burns, his hair stands on end. The master archer's body refuses its trained function.

From the Advaitic perspective, these physical manifestations reveal how deeply the mind's conflict penetrates the body. The burning skin, the trembling—these are not separate from the moral crisis. Body and mind are not two; the anguish of conscience expresses through flesh.

When we face impossible choices, the body often knows before the mind admits it. Arjuna's physical symptoms are a form of wisdom—his entire being registering that something is profoundly wrong. This bodily honesty, though painful, is more trustworthy than the mind's rationalizations.`

    transliteration: 'na ca śaknomy avasthātuṁ bhramatīva ca me manaḥ\nnimittāni ca paśyāmi viparītāni keśava',
    translation: 'I am unable to stand steady, my mind seems to whirl, and I see adverse omens, O Keshava.',
    commentary: `Now the crisis moves from body to mind. Arjuna cannot stand steady—not just physically but mentally. His mind whirls, and everywhere he looks he sees ill omens. The world itself seems to confirm his dread.

Shankaracharya would note that the "adverse omens" are projections of an agitated mind. When consciousness is disturbed, it sees its own turbulence reflected in external signs. The omens are real to Arjuna, but they arise from his state rather than from objective reality.

This verse captures a universal experience: when anxiety takes hold, everything seems to confirm our fears. The mind that cannot find stability sees instability everywhere. Recognizing this—that troubled perception colors what we see—is itself a step toward clarity. The mind observing its own whirling has not entirely lost its witness.`

    translation: 'Nor do I see any good in killing my own kinsmen in battle. I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.',
    commentary: `Here Arjuna articulates what his body already expressed: he sees no good outcome. Victory itself has lost its meaning. Kingdom and pleasures—the conventional rewards of battle—seem hollow when purchased with the blood of those he loves.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this is a crucial turning point. Arjuna is questioning the very framework of desire and reward that motivates ordinary action. "I do not desire victory"—this is not laziness but a profound disillusionment with the fruits of action.

When the prizes we have pursued suddenly seem worthless, it can feel like despair. But it may also be the beginning of wisdom. Arjuna's loss of desire for kingdom and pleasure clears space for a deeper question: if not these, then what? This emptying of conventional motivation prepares the ground for Krishna's teaching.`

    sanskrit: 'किं नो राज्येन गोविन्द किं भोगैर्जीवितेन वा |\nयेषामर्थे काङ्क्षितं नो राज्यं भोगाः सुखानि च ||',
    transliteration: 'kiṁ no rājyena govinda kiṁ bhogair jīvitena vā\nyeṣām arthe kāṅkṣitaṁ no rājyaṁ bhogāḥ sukhāni ca',
    translation: 'Of what avail is dominion to us, O Govinda? Of what avail are enjoyments and even life? Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures stand here in battle.',
    commentary: `Arjuna's questioning deepens. He sees that the very people for whom he would win the kingdom—teachers, uncles, cousins—are the ones he must destroy to obtain it. The goal negates itself. What use is victory if those who would share in its fruits are dead?

Shankaracharya sees here the logic of attachment exposed. We pursue things "for the sake of" those we love. But when the pursuit itself harms those we love, the entire structure of motivation collapses. This is not philosophical argument but lived realization.

This verse speaks to anyone who has achieved something only to find the achievement meaningless. Arjuna confronts the possibility that the life he has been living—warrior, prince, champion—may not be the life worth living. Such moments of radical questioning, though painful, are doorways to transformation.`

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'त एते स्थिता युद्धे प्राणांस्त्यक्त्वा धनानि च |\nआचार्याः पितरः पुत्रास्तथैव च पितामहाः ||',
    transliteration: 'ta ete sthitā yuddhe prāṇāṁs tyaktvā dhanāni ca\nācāryāḥ pitaraḥ putrās tathaiva ca pitāmahāḥ',
    translation: 'Teachers, fathers, sons, as well as grandfathers, stand here in battle, having staked their lives and wealth.',
    commentary: `Arjuna names them now: teachers (ācāryāḥ), fathers (pitaraḥ), sons (putrāḥ), grandfathers (pitāmahāḥ). Each word carries the weight of specific relationships—Drona who taught him archery, Bhishma who held him as a child. These are not abstractions but faces, memories, bonds.

From the Advaitic view, Arjuna is caught in the web of saṁsāra—the world of relationships, obligations, and attachments that constitutes ordinary existence. Each relationship carries duties; each duty conflicts with others. The warrior's dharma conflicts with the kinsman's dharma.

When duty conflicts with duty, no clever reasoning resolves the dilemma. Arjuna's catalogue of relationships is also a catalogue of impossible obligations. Recognizing this impossibility honestly—without pretending there is an easy answer—is itself a form of integrity.`

    transliteration: 'mātulāḥ śvaśurāḥ pautrāḥ śyālāḥ sambandhinas tathā\netān na hantum icchāmi ghnato\'pi madhusūdana',
    translation: 'Maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives—these I do not wish to kill, O Madhusudana, even though they may kill me.',
    commentary: `The catalogue continues: uncles, in-laws, grandsons, relatives of every kind. And then the remarkable statement: "even though they may kill me." Arjuna would rather die than slay them. This is not strategy or calculation but raw moral feeling.

Shankaracharya notes that Arjuna's willingness to die rather than kill reveals something beyond ordinary self-interest. He is not simply afraid to fight—he would accept death. What he cannot accept is becoming the instrument of destruction for those he loves.

There are situations where no action feels right, and inaction also feels wrong. Arjuna's statement that he would accept death shows he has moved beyond calculating outcomes. He is speaking from a place where conventional ethics have broken down, which is precisely where genuine inquiry can begin.`

    transliteration: 'api trailokya-rājyasya hetoḥ kiṁ nu mahī-kṛte\nihatya dhārtarāṣṭrān naḥ kā prītiḥ syāj janārdana',
    translation: 'For the sake of dominion over the three worlds, let alone for this earth, I do not wish to kill them. What pleasure can there be for us after killing the sons of Dhritarashtra, O Janardana?',
    commentary: `Arjuna escalates his argument: not even sovereignty over the three worlds—heaven, earth, and the netherworld—would justify this killing. The highest possible reward cannot outweigh the deed required to obtain it.

From the Advaitic perspective, this verse reveals that Arjuna has intuitively grasped something important: no external reward can compensate for a violation of one's deepest sense of right. The "pleasure" (prīti) he questions is the false satisfaction that the ego promises when it calculates benefit.

When we ask "what is the point?" we may be approaching wisdom or despair—sometimes both. Arjuna's question strips away all the conventional answers. If neither earth nor heaven justifies this action, then on what ground can it be justified at all? This question will require a complete reframing, which Krishna will provide.`

    transliteration: 'pāpam evāśrayed asmān hatvaitān ātatāyinaḥ\ntasmān nārhā vayaṁ hantuṁ dhārtarāṣṭrān sa-bāndhavān',
    translation: 'Sin alone would accrue to us by killing these felons. Therefore, we should not kill our kinsmen, the sons of Dhritarashtra. How can we be happy after killing our own people, O Madhava?',
    commentary: `Arjuna now invokes sin (pāpa). Even though the Kauravas are aggressors (ātatāyinaḥ)—those who attack with deadly weapons—Arjuna argues that killing them would bring only sin. He calls them both "felons" and "kinsmen" in the same breath, revealing his conflict.

Shankaracharya would observe that Arjuna is trying to apply conventional morality to an unconventional situation. The scriptures do permit killing an aggressor, yet Arjuna's conscience resists. He is caught between what is legally permitted and what his heart can bear.

Sometimes rules permit what conscience forbids. Arjuna's refusal to hide behind legal or scriptural permission shows moral sensitivity. He will not do something merely because it is allowed. This integrity, though it paralyzes him now, is also what makes him worthy of receiving Krishna's teaching.`

    sanskrit: 'स्वजनं हि कथं हत्वा सुखिनः स्याम माधव |\nतस्मान्नार्हा वयं हन्तुं धार्तराष्ट्रान्सबान्धवान् ||',
    transliteration: 'sva-janaṁ hi kathaṁ hatvā sukhinaḥ syāma mādhava\ntasmān nārhā vayaṁ hantuṁ dhārtarāṣṭrān sa-bāndhavān',
    translation: 'How can we be happy after killing our own kinsmen, O Madhava? Therefore, we are not justified in killing the sons of Dhritarashtra along with their relatives.',
    commentary: `The question "how can we be happy?" echoes through Arjuna's lament. He imagines the aftermath—a kingdom built on the corpses of those he loved—and finds no happiness in that vision. The victory would be hollow, the throne stained.

From the Advaitic standpoint, Arjuna is discovering that happiness cannot be built on a foundation of inner conflict. Even if external circumstances change in his favor, his inner state would remain disturbed by what he had done. No amount of success compensates for a violated conscience.

This insight—that outer success cannot heal inner wounds—is valuable. Arjuna sees that the happiness he thought victory would bring is an illusion. This disillusionment, though painful, prepares him to hear a different kind of teaching about action, duty, and freedom.`

    translation: 'Though these, with their minds overpowered by greed, see no evil in the destruction of families and no sin in treachery to friends...',
    commentary: `Arjuna now speaks of the Kauravas—their minds "overpowered by greed" (lobhopahata-cetasaḥ). They cannot see the sin in what they do because desire has blinded them. But does their blindness excuse the Pandavas from moral responsibility?

Shankaracharya notes that Arjuna recognizes a universal human tendency: greed clouds perception. The greedy do not experience themselves as greedy; they experience themselves as practical, as realistic, as doing what must be done. Moral blindness does not announce itself.

This observation about the Kauravas is also a warning to ourselves. We rarely recognize when our own perception is clouded by desire. Arjuna's ability to see the Kauravas' blindness is wisdom; the question is whether he can also examine his own vision with equal clarity.`

    translation: '...why should we not have the wisdom to turn away from this sin, we who clearly see the evil in the destruction of families, O Janardana?',
    commentary: `Arjuna's argument culminates: since we can see what they cannot see, should we not act on that clearer vision? If we know it is wrong, how can we proceed? Knowledge of evil, he implies, obligates us to refrain from it.

From the Advaitic perspective, this is both right and incomplete. Arjuna is right that knowledge should inform action. But his knowledge is still partial—he sees the evil of killing but not the full picture of dharma, duty, and the nature of action itself.

The conviction "I see clearly, therefore I know what to do" can be either wisdom or obstacle. Arjuna's clarity about the evil of destruction is real. What he lacks is understanding of the deeper context in which action must sometimes be taken despite its painful consequences.`

    translation: 'On the destruction of a family, the immemorial family traditions perish. When traditions perish, lawlessness overcomes the whole family.',
    commentary: `Arjuna now argues from social consequence. The destruction of families leads to the loss of dharma—the traditions, customs, and values transmitted across generations. Without these, adharma (lawlessness) prevails. His concern extends beyond immediate death to civilizational collapse.

Shankaracharya sees merit in this concern. Tradition (kula-dharma) does transmit wisdom across generations. Its destruction does have consequences. But Arjuna's argument, while valid at one level, may also be a rationalization—using high-sounding reasons to justify his emotional resistance.

The preservation of tradition is a real value, but it is not the highest value. Sometimes traditions must change or even die for something truer to emerge. Arjuna's argument would freeze the world in its current state to avoid the pain of transformation.`

    transliteration: 'aho bata mahat pāpaṁ kartuṁ vyavasitā vayam\nyad rājya-sukha-lobhena hantuṁ sva-janam udyatāḥ',
    translation: 'Alas! We have resolved to commit a great sin, in that we are endeavoring to kill our own kinsmen out of a craving for the pleasures of dominion.',
    commentary: `"Aho bata"—alas! Arjuna cries out at the absurdity of his situation. He sees himself and his brothers as about to commit great sin, driven by the very greed (lobha) he condemned in the Kauravas. The self-judgment is harsh: we are no better than them.

From the Advaitic view, this self-awareness is crucial. Arjuna sees that he too is caught in desire. The Pandavas' claim to righteousness does not exempt them from the taint of wanting. This honesty about his own motivation—rare and valuable—strips away any sense of moral superiority.

When we recognize our own complicity in what we condemn, we approach genuine humility. Arjuna's cry of "alas" is the sound of ego deflating, of pretense falling away. This raw honesty, though painful, creates the opening for grace.`

    translation: 'It would be better for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, should slay me in battle, unarmed and unresisting.',
    commentary: `Arjuna's despair reaches its deepest point. He would rather die—unarmed, unresisting—than fight. This is not the voice of a coward but of a man who has lost all sense of meaningful action. Death seems preferable to the burden of choice.

Shankaracharya recognizes this as the moment before transformation. Arjuna has exhausted all his arguments, all his reasons. He has reached the end of what his own thinking can offer. This emptiness, this surrender of the calculating mind, is precisely where teaching can enter.

When we have truly given up—not as strategy but as genuine collapse of our usual ways of coping—something else becomes possible. Arjuna's willingness to die rather than act wrongly is, paradoxically, his qualification to receive right action.`

From the Advaitic standpoint, this collapse is necessary. The old Arjuna—confident, capable, knowing his role—must die before the new Arjuna can be born. His sitting down is not defeat but the acknowledgment that his previous understanding has reached its limit.

Chapter One ends in darkness, but it is the darkness before dawn. Arjuna's crisis has prepared him to truly listen. His arguments exhausted, his body failed, his mind overwhelmed—he is finally empty enough to receive. This is where Chapter Two, and Krishna's teaching, will begin.`
