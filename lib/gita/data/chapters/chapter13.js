    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nइदं शरीरं कौन्तेय क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते |\nएतद्यो वेत्ति तं प्राहुः क्षेत्रज्ञ इति तद्विदः ||',
    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nidaṁ śarīraṁ kaunteya kṣetram ity abhidhīyate\netad yo vetti taṁ prāhuḥ kṣetrajña iti tad-vidaḥ',
    translation: 'The Lord said: This body, O son of Kunti, is called the field. One who knows it is called the knower of the field by those who know.',
    commentary: `The central distinction: kṣetra (field) is the body; kṣetrajña (knower of the field) is consciousness. The body is that which is known; the knower is that which knows. This discrimination is fundamental to self-knowledge.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that "field" includes not just the physical body but the entire psychophysical apparatus—mind, senses, ego. All that can be objectified is field. Only pure awareness, which cannot be objectified, is the knower.

"Those who know" (tad-vidaḥ) indicates this is not Krishna's invention but the teaching of the wise across traditions. The field-knower distinction is perennial wisdom, found wherever true inquiry has occurred.`

    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि मां विद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रेषु भारत |\nक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोर्ज्ञानं यत्तज्ज्ञानं मतं मम ||',
    transliteration: 'kṣetrajñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata\nkṣetra-kṣetrajñayor jñānaṁ yat taj jñānaṁ mataṁ mama',
    translation: 'Know Me also as the knower of the field in all fields, O Bharata. Knowledge of the field and the knower of the field I consider to be (true) knowledge.',
    commentary: `The stunning revelation: "Know Me as the knower in all fields" (kṣetrajñaṁ māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu). Not only is there a knower in each body—that knower is Krishna. The same consciousness looks through all eyes.

This is non-duality stated clearly. The individual knower and the supreme knower are ultimately one. The apparent multiplicity of knowers is appearance; the reality is one consciousness knowing through many fields.

"True knowledge" (jñānam) is defined as knowing this distinction. Not scientific knowledge, not philosophical speculation, but direct recognition of the field-knower relationship. This knowledge liberates.`

  // What constitutes the field

    verse: 5,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'महाभूतान्यहंकारो बुद्धिरव्यक्तमेव च |\nइन्द्रियाणि दशैकं च पञ्च चेन्द्रियगोचराः ||',
    transliteration: 'mahā-bhūtāny ahaṅkāro buddhir avyaktam eva ca\nindriyāṇi daśaikaṁ ca pañca cendriya-gocarāḥ',
    translation: 'The great elements, ego, intellect, and the unmanifested; the ten senses and one (mind); and the five objects of the senses...',
    commentary: `The field enumerated: five great elements, ego (ahaṅkāra), intellect (buddhi), the unmanifest (prakriti), ten senses (five of perception, five of action), the mind, and five sense objects. This is the complete psychophysical system.

Note that even ego, intellect, and mind are part of the field—they are known, not the knower. Many mistake the ego for the self, but the ego can be observed and therefore is object, not subject.

This list maps the territory of experience. Everything we can experience or think about falls into one of these categories. Whatever is in this list is "field"; whatever knows this list is "knower."`

  // What constitutes knowledge

    verse: 7,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'peace'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'अमानित्वमदम्भित्वमहिंसा क्षान्तिरार्जवम् |\nआचार्योपासनं शौचं स्थैर्यमात्मविनिग्रहः ||',
    transliteration: 'amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam\nācāryopāsanaṁ śaucaṁ sthairyam ātma-vinigrahaḥ',
    translation: 'Humility, non-pretentiousness, non-violence, patience, uprightness, service to the teacher, purity, steadfastness, and self-control...',
    commentary: `Now begins the list of qualities that constitute "knowledge" (jñāna) in the practical sense—the virtues and attitudes that prepare the mind for realization. Starting with humility (amānitva) and non-pretense (adambhitva).

These are not beliefs but qualities of character. True knowledge is not just intellectual understanding but transformation of being. These virtues create the inner environment where recognition of the field-knower distinction can occur.

Service to the teacher (ācāryopāsana) acknowledges that this knowledge typically requires guidance. Self-effort alone is difficult; a teacher who has realized can transmit understanding directly.`

  // Detachment and discrimination

    verse: 8,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['detachment', 'knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यमनहङ्कार एव च |\nजन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदुःखदोषानुदर्शनम् ||',
    transliteration: 'indriyārtheṣu vairāgyam anahaṅkāra eva ca\njanma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam',
    translation: '...detachment from sense objects, absence of ego, and constant reflection on the evils of birth, death, old age, disease, and suffering...',
    commentary: `The list continues: detachment (vairāgya) from sense objects, freedom from ego (anahaṅkāra), and—crucially—constant reflection on suffering's inevitability. Birth, death, old age, disease are not morbid topics but motivators for liberation.

This "constant reflection" (anudarśanam) on suffering keeps motivation alive. Forgetting suffering's reality leads to complacency; remembering it fuels inquiry. The wise don't avoid this reflection but use it skillfully.

"Absence of ego" is easier said than done, but it's listed as a quality of knowledge—meaning: as knowledge deepens, ego naturally dissolves. The practice of egolessness and the recognition of truth support each other.`

  // The object of knowledge

    verse: 12,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'ज्ञेयं यत्तत्प्रवक्ष्यामि यज्ज्ञात्वामृतमश्नुते |\nअनादिमत्परं ब्रह्म न सत्तन्नासदुच्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'jñeyaṁ yat tat pravakṣyāmi yaj jñātvāmṛtam aśnute\nanādi mat-paraṁ brahma na sat tan nāsad ucyate',
    translation: 'I shall declare that which is to be known, knowing which one attains immortality. It is the beginningless supreme Brahman, said to be neither existent nor non-existent.',
    commentary: `Krishna now describes what is to be known (jñeyam)—the knowledge that confers immortality. It is "beginningless supreme Brahman" (anādi mat-paraṁ brahma), beyond the categories of existence and non-existence.

"Neither existent nor non-existent" (na sat tan nāsad) indicates transcendence of ordinary duality. Brahman cannot be captured by positive or negative attribution. It's not "something" (which would make it an object); it's not "nothing" (which would make it non-existent). It's beyond both.

"Knowing which one attains immortality" (jñātvā amṛtam aśnute) makes the stakes clear. This is not academic philosophy but the knowledge that liberates from death. The goal is not information but transformation.`

    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'सर्वतः पाणिपादं तत्सर्वतोऽक्षिशिरोमुखम् |\nसर्वतः श्रुतिमल्लोके सर्वमावृत्य तिष्ठति ||',
    transliteration: 'sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādaṁ tat sarvato\'kṣi-śiro-mukham\nsarvataḥ śrutimal loke sarvam āvṛtya tiṣṭhati',
    translation: 'With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads, and mouths everywhere, with ears everywhere, It exists encompassing all in the world.',
    commentary: `Brahman described through paradoxical imagery: hands and feet everywhere, eyes and heads everywhere, ears everywhere. This indicates omnipresence through all beings—Brahman experiences through every hand, sees through every eye.

This is not saying Brahman has billions of hands literally, but that every hand is Brahman's hand, every eye is Brahman's eye. The multiplicity of forms is the single Brahman appearing as many.

"Encompassing all" (sarvam āvṛtya tiṣṭhati) indicates that nothing exists outside Brahman. Whatever is, is within Brahman. There is no place where Brahman is not, no experience Brahman does not have.`

  // Beyond the gunas yet experiencing them

    verse: 14,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'सर्वेन्द्रियगुणाभासं सर्वेन्द्रियविवर्जितम् |\nअसक्तं सर्वभृच्चैव निर्गुणं गुणभोक्तृ च ||',
    transliteration: 'sarvendriya-guṇābhāsaṁ sarvendriya-vivarjitam\nasaktaṁ sarva-bhṛc caiva nirguṇaṁ guṇa-bhoktṛ ca',
    translation: 'Shining through the functions of all senses, yet devoid of all senses; unattached yet sustaining all; free from gunas yet experiencing the gunas.',
    commentary: `More paradox: functioning through senses yet without senses; unattached yet sustaining all; without qualities yet experiencing qualities. These are not contradictions but descriptions of a reality that transcends ordinary categories.

Shankaracharya explains: Brahman is the light by which the senses function but is not itself sensory. It sustains everything without being attached to anything. It has no qualities (nirguna) in itself yet experiences qualities through beings.

The "gunas" (qualities of nature: sattva, rajas, tamas) are experienced in the field by the knower, but the knower is not made of gunas. This is like a mirror reflecting colors without becoming colored.`

  // The witness-knower

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'उपद्रष्टानुमन्ता च भर्ता भोक्ता महेश्वरः |\nपरमात्मेति चाप्युक्तो देहेऽस्मिन्पुरुषः परः ||',
    transliteration: 'upadraṣṭānumantā ca bhartā bhoktā maheśvaraḥ\nparamātmeti cāpy ukto dehe\'smin puruṣaḥ paraḥ',
    translation: 'Witness, permitter, sustainer, experiencer, great Lord, and also called the Supreme Self—this is the supreme Person in this body.',
    commentary: `The knower in the body has many names and functions: witness (upadraṣṭā) who observes, permitter (anumantā) who sanctions, sustainer (bhartā) who supports, experiencer (bhoktā) who enjoys, great Lord (maheśvara), supreme Self (paramātmā).

These describe the same reality from different angles. As witness, consciousness simply observes. As permitter, it allows experience to happen. As sustainer, it is the ground of existence. As experiencer, it is that for which experience exists.

"Supreme Person in this body" (dehe'smin puruṣaḥ paraḥ) brings the teaching home. The ultimate reality is not far away but intimately present—in this very body, as the one who knows the body. The search ends where it began.`

  // One who knows this is liberated

    verse: 23,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'hope'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'य एवं वेत्ति पुरुषं प्रकृतिं च गुणैः सह |\nसर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि न स भूयोऽभिजायते ||',
    transliteration: 'ya evaṁ vetti puruṣaṁ prakṛtiṁ ca guṇaiḥ saha\nsarvathā vartamāno\'pi na sa bhūyo\'bhijāyate',
    translation: 'One who thus knows Purusha and Prakriti along with the gunas, however they may be living, is not born again.',
    commentary: `The liberating knowledge: understanding purusha (consciousness), prakriti (nature), and the gunas (qualities) as distinct. Whoever knows this "is not born again" (na bhūyo'bhijāyate)—regardless of their outer circumstances.

"However they may be living" (sarvathā vartamāno'pi) is significant. Liberation doesn't require a particular lifestyle. The householder and the renunciate, the active and the contemplative—whoever gains this understanding is freed.

The knowledge is simple but profound: "I am the knower, not the field. The body-mind is prakriti operating through gunas. I witness it all but am not it." This recognition, deeply realized, ends rebirth.`
