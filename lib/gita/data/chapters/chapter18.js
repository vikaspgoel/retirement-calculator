    translation: 'Arjuna said: O mighty-armed one, I wish to know the truth about renunciation (sannyasa) and also about abandonment (tyaga), O Hrishikesha, O slayer of Keshi.',
    commentary: `In this final chapter, Arjuna asks the essential question: what is the difference between sannyasa (renunciation of all action) and tyaga (abandonment of the fruits of action)? This question shows how far Arjuna has come—from paralysis born of confusion to genuine philosophical inquiry.

Shankaracharya notes that this question is crucial for understanding the path to liberation. Is it necessary to abandon all action? Or can one act while abandoning attachment to results? Krishna's answer will clarify how liberation is possible for all, not just those who renounce worldly life.

The question arises at the end because now Arjuna is ready to understand the subtlety. He has absorbed seventeen chapters of teaching. Now he seeks the practical conclusion: how exactly should I live? This is always the final question—not what is true, but how to embody truth.`

    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nकाम्यानां कर्मणां न्यासं संन्यासं कवयो विदुः |\nसर्वकर्मफलत्यागं प्राहुस्त्यागं विचक्षणाः ||',
    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nkāmyānāṁ karmaṇāṁ nyāsaṁ sannyāsaṁ kavayo viduḥ\nsarva-karma-phala-tyāgaṁ prāhus tyāgaṁ vicakṣaṇāḥ',
    translation: 'The Lord said: The sages understand sannyasa as the renunciation of desire-prompted actions. The wise declare tyaga to be the abandonment of the fruits of all actions.',
    commentary: `Krishna distinguishes two forms of letting go. Sannyasa is giving up actions motivated by desire—no longer doing things because we want their results. Tyaga is performing actions but abandoning attachment to their fruits—acting without claiming ownership of outcomes.

From the Advaitic standpoint, both point to the same freedom but from different angles. Sannyasa addresses the question "what should I do?" by saying don't act from desire. Tyaga addresses "how should I relate to what happens?" by saying release the outcomes.

For practical life, tyaga is often more applicable. Few can abandon all action, but everyone can work on releasing attachment to results. This does not mean not caring about quality or effort—it means not staking one's peace on whether results match expectations.`

    sanskrit: 'कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन |\nसङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलं चैव स त्यागः सात्त्विको मतः ||',
    transliteration: 'kāryam ity eva yat karma niyataṁ kriyate\'rjuna\nsaṅgaṁ tyaktvā phalaṁ caiva sa tyāgaḥ sāttviko mataḥ',
    translation: 'That action which is ordained, performed merely because it ought to be done, abandoning attachment and fruit—that renunciation is regarded as sattvic.',
    commentary: `Here is the formula for liberated action: do what should be done (kāryam), because it should be done (iti eva), without attachment (saṅgaṁ tyaktvā), without claiming the fruits (phalaṁ ca). This is sattvic tyaga—the highest form of renunciation within action.

Shankaracharya explains that "ordained" (niyata) refers to one's appropriate duties according to one's nature and circumstances. The point is not to calculate outcomes but to respond appropriately to what life presents. The action arises from clarity about what is fitting, not from desire for results.

This verse offers practical guidance: identify what needs to be done, do it well, and release it. The doing is wholehearted; the releasing is also wholehearted. This is not indifference but freedom—caring without being controlled by the caring.`

    translation: 'That knowledge by which one sees the one imperishable reality in all beings, undivided in the divided—know that knowledge to be sattvic.',
    commentary: `Sattvic knowledge sees unity in diversity. Though beings appear separate—divided (vibhakteṣu)—the wise perceive the undivided (avibhakta) reality that is their common ground. This is not ignoring differences but seeing through them to the underlying oneness.

From the Advaitic view, this verse describes the direct perception of non-duality. The same consciousness that reads these words is present in every sentient being. Forms differ; the awareness that illumines all forms is one. This recognition is sattvic knowledge.

This knowledge transforms relationship. When we see ourselves in others, compassion becomes natural. We do not harm what we recognize as ourselves. The ethical implications of non-dual vision are profound—it makes love the only reasonable response to existence.`

    transliteration: 'niyataṁ saṅga-rahitam arāga-dveṣataḥ kṛtam\naphala-prepsunā karma yat tat sāttvikam ucyate',
    translation: 'Action which is ordained, free from attachment, done without attraction or aversion, by one not desirous of fruit—that action is called sattvic.',
    commentary: `Four qualities define sattvic action: ordained (appropriate to one's situation), free from attachment (saṅga-rahita), done without attraction or aversion (arāga-dveṣataḥ), and performed without desire for results (aphala-prepsunā). These are not four separate requirements but four aspects of the same free action.

Shankaracharya notes that "without attraction or aversion" does not mean without feeling. It means not being controlled by likes and dislikes. We may prefer certain outcomes, but preference does not dictate action—clarity does.

This verse describes what work feels like when done from freedom rather than compulsion. There is effort without strain, care without anxiety, engagement without entanglement. The action flows because it is the right response, not because we are chasing or avoiding something.`

    transliteration: 'yat tad agre viṣam iva pariṇāme\'mṛtopamam\ntat sukhaṁ sāttvikaṁ proktam ātma-buddhi-prasāda-jam',
    translation: 'That which is like poison at first but like nectar at the end, that happiness is declared to be sattvic, born of the clarity of self-knowledge.',
    commentary: `Sattvic happiness tastes like poison initially—the discipline of practice, the pain of facing oneself, the difficulty of changing habits—but becomes nectar (amṛta) as it matures. This is the happiness "born of clarity" (prasāda-jam), arising from a settled, purified mind.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this describes the path accurately. Self-inquiry can be uncomfortable. Meditation may initially reveal restlessness. Facing our patterns is not pleasant. But as practice deepens, a sweetness emerges that does not depend on circumstances—the nectar of self-knowledge.

This verse distinguishes lasting happiness from immediate gratification. Rajasic pleasure (verse 38) is nectar first, poison later—sense pleasures that leave us depleted. The wise invest in what grows sweeter with time, even if the initial taste is bitter.`

    transliteration: 'na tad asti pṛthivyāṁ vā divi deveṣu vā punaḥ\nsattvaṁ prakṛti-jair muktaṁ yad ebhiḥ syāt tribhir guṇaiḥ',
    translation: 'There is no being on earth or in heaven among the gods that is free from these three gunas born of prakriti.',
    commentary: `This verse establishes a fundamental truth: as long as there is manifestation, there are gunas. Even the gods are not free from sattva, rajas, and tamas. This is not pessimism but realism—and it points beyond manifestation to what is truly free.

Shankaracharya explains that liberation is not about perfecting the gunas but transcending them entirely. As long as we identify with body-mind, we are subject to the play of gunas. Only the Self—pure awareness—is beyond all qualities.

This teaching prevents spiritual bypassing. We cannot escape the gunas by pretending we have transcended them. The path is through understanding and acceptance, not denial. Recognizing that all beings are subject to the gunas can also generate compassion—everyone is doing their best within their current balance of forces.`

    transliteration: 'yataḥ pravṛttir bhūtānāṁ yena sarvam idaṁ tatam\nsva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya siddhiṁ vindati mānavaḥ',
    translation: 'He from whom all beings have their origin, by whom all this is pervaded—worshipping Him through one\'s own duty, a person attains perfection.',
    commentary: `Here is the Gita's synthesis of action and devotion. The Divine is both origin (yataḥ pravṛttiḥ) and presence (yena sarvam idaṁ tatam)—the source from which all emerges and the awareness that pervades all. We worship this Divine through our own appropriate action (sva-karmaṇā).

From the Advaitic view, this transforms all work into worship. The carpenter who works with care, the teacher who teaches with love, the caregiver who serves with presence—all are worshipping the Divine that pervades everything. No special ritual is needed; right action is the ritual.

"Perfection" (siddhi) here means becoming qualified for Self-knowledge. Work done as worship purifies the mind, reduces ego, and creates the conditions for wisdom to arise. This is the alchemy of karma yoga: ordinary action becomes the path to liberation.`

    translation: 'Better is one\'s own dharma, though imperfect, than the dharma of another well performed. Performing action determined by one\'s own nature, one does not incur sin.',
    commentary: `This verse, which also appears in Chapter 3, is repeated here for emphasis. Your own path, even walked imperfectly, is better than someone else's path walked perfectly. This is not about hierarchy of roles but about authenticity of expression.

Shankaracharya explains that "determined by one's own nature" (svabhāva-niyata) points to the unique configuration of tendencies, capacities, and circumstances that define each person's situation. Fighting this nature leads to conflict; working with it leads to flow.

The teaching addresses comparison and envy. We often want someone else's life, someone else's gifts, someone else's path. But we can only walk our own path. The Gita says: walk it fully, even imperfectly, and you incur no sin. The sin is in abandoning your own truth for an imitation of another's.`

    translation: 'One whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has mastered the self, from whom desire has fled—such a one attains the supreme state of freedom from action through renunciation.',
    commentary: `Naishkarmya-siddhi—perfection in actionlessness—does not mean doing nothing. It means reaching a state where actions no longer bind. The Self does not act; the gunas interact with gunas. The wise person, identifying with the Self rather than the body-mind, is free even while the body acts.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this is the culmination: unattached everywhere (asakta-buddhiḥ sarvatra), self-mastered (jitātmā), desire-free (vigata-spṛhaḥ). These are not achievements of the ego but recognitions that dawn when the ego is seen through. The Self was always free; what changes is our knowing.

This supreme state is available now. It is not earned through time but recognized in the timeless. The body continues its functions; the wise person no longer mistakes those functions for their identity. This is liberation—not somewhere else, not sometime later, but here, now, as what we already are.`

Controlling the self (ātmānaṁ niyamya)—not suppressing but governing the mind with firmness (dhṛtyā). This is discipline in the service of freedom.

Shankaracharya notes that "abandoning sense objects" does not mean physical withdrawal from the world but not being driven by them. The senses still function; we are no longer their slaves. Attraction and aversion still arise; they no longer dictate our responses.

This verse continues into the next, forming a description of the sage's way of life. The key word is "endowed" (yukta)—these qualities come not from effort alone but from a certain ripening of understanding. The practices create conditions; grace completes the work.`

    translation: '...resorting to solitude, eating lightly, with speech, body, and mind controlled, constantly devoted to meditation and yoga, taking refuge in dispassion...',
    commentary: `The description continues: solitude (vivikta-sevī) for reducing distractions, eating lightly (laghv-āśī) for clarity, controlling speech, body, and mind (yata-vāk-kāya-mānasaḥ) for integrity. Constantly devoted to meditation (dhyāna-yoga-paro nityaṁ) and grounded in dispassion (vairāgyaṁ samupāśritaḥ).

From the Advaitic view, these are not arbitrary rules but practical supports for what naturally happens when understanding deepens. The sage seeks solitude because silence reveals what noise obscures. Eating lightly keeps the mind clear. Controlling speech prevents the energy loss of unnecessary talk.

"Taking refuge in dispassion" (vairāgyaṁ samupāśritaḥ) is key. Dispassion is not coldness but freedom from compulsion. We can enjoy without needing to enjoy. We can lose without being destroyed by loss. This refuge is in what cannot be taken away.`

    transliteration: 'ahaṅkāraṁ balaṁ darpaṁ kāmaṁ krodhaṁ parigraham\nvimucya nirmamaḥ śānto brahma-bhūyāya kalpate',
    translation: '...having abandoned egoism, force, arrogance, desire, anger, and possessiveness, free from the sense of "mine," peaceful—such a one is fit for becoming Brahman.',
    commentary: `The final list of what must be released: egoism (ahaṅkāra), force (bala—using power wrongly), arrogance (darpa), desire (kāma), anger (krodha), possessiveness (parigraha). Free from "mine" (nirmamaḥ), peaceful (śānta)—such a one is "fit for becoming Brahman."

Shankaracharya clarifies that "becoming Brahman" does not mean the individual becomes something it was not. It means the apparent individual recognizes what it always was. The cloud does not become sky; it disperses, revealing the sky that was always there.

This verse completes the portrait of the liberated person. Notice it does not describe special powers or achievements. It describes what has been released: ego, aggression, pride, craving, anger, grasping. Liberation is not addition but subtraction—the falling away of what was never truly ours.`

    transliteration: 'brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati\nsamaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām',
    translation: 'Becoming Brahman, serene in the Self, one neither grieves nor desires. Seeing all beings as equal, one attains supreme devotion to Me.',
    commentary: `The fruits of realization: serenity (prasannātmā), freedom from grief and craving (na śocati na kāṅkṣati), seeing all beings as equal (samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu). And from this state arises supreme devotion (parā bhakti)—not devotion as a means to liberation but devotion as the natural expression of liberation.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this verse shows that jnana (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion) are not opposites but culminate in each other. The one who knows Brahman loves Brahman. The distinction between knower, known, and knowing dissolves into love.

"Seeing all beings as equal" (samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu) is the ethical fruit of non-dual vision. When the same Self is seen in all, exploitation becomes impossible and service becomes natural. This is not equality imposed by concept but equality recognized in direct vision.`

    translation: 'Through devotion one comes to know Me in truth—what and who I am. Then, knowing Me in truth, one enters into Me forthwith.',
    commentary: `Devotion (bhakti) leads to true knowledge (tattvataḥ jñātvā), and true knowledge leads to entering (viśate)—union. The progression is devotion → knowledge → absorption. These are not separate stages but aspects of one movement of consciousness returning to its source.

Shankaracharya explains that "entering into Me" is not spatial but the dissolution of the sense of separation. There is no distance to cross; there is only the illusion of distance to recognize as illusion. When true knowledge dawns, the apparent separation between devotee and Divine is seen to have never existed.

"Forthwith" (tad-anantaram) is significant. Liberation is not delayed once true knowledge arises. It is immediate. The moment you see the rope was never a snake, fear dissolves. The moment the Self is known, bondage ends. There is no gap between knowing and freedom.`

    translation: 'The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all beings to revolve by His maya, as if mounted on a machine.',
    commentary: `Here is a profound image: the Lord (Īśvara) dwells in every heart (hṛd-deśe), and through maya (creative power), beings are caused to revolve as if on a machine (yantra). This does not diminish free will but reveals its ground—the Divine is the animator of all animation.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this verse points to the immanence of the Divine. Not somewhere far away, but in the heart—closer than the closest. The machinery of body-mind operates, driven by the Lord's power. What we mistake for personal action is the play of cosmic energy.

This understanding shifts the sense of doership. The individual does not disappear but is seen in proper context—as an instrument, a machine through which the Divine acts. This is not fatalism but recognition. We do our best, knowing that a larger power moves through all.`

    translation: 'Take refuge in Him alone with your whole being, O Bharata. By His grace you shall attain supreme peace and the eternal abode.',
    commentary: `"Take refuge... with your whole being" (sarva-bhāvena śaraṇaṁ gaccha)—not partially, not occasionally, but completely. This is the teaching of total surrender. And the promise: by His grace (tat-prasādāt), supreme peace and the eternal abode will be attained.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that this refuge is not passive resignation but active alignment. We offer ourselves completely to the Divine will, trusting that what unfolds is for the highest good. This is not giving up but giving over—transferring the burden of separate selfhood to the infinite.

"By His grace" (tat-prasādāt) acknowledges that liberation is not merely achieved but received. Our effort creates receptivity; grace completes the work. This balance of self-effort and grace is the heart of Indian spirituality—we do what we can, and something beyond us does the rest.`

    translation: 'Thus has this knowledge, more secret than all secrets, been declared to you by Me. Reflect on it fully, and then do as you wish.',
    commentary: `Krishna concludes the teaching by honoring Arjuna's freedom: "Do as you wish" (yathecchasi tathā kuru). After seventeen chapters of teaching, Krishna does not command—he invites. Reflect fully (vimṛśya aśeṣeṇa), then choose. The Divine respects human autonomy.

From the Advaitic view, this is crucial. Truth cannot be forced; it can only be recognized. Krishna has shown the way; walking it remains Arjuna's choice. This is not indifference but profound respect for the soul's journey. Each being must find their own readiness, their own timing.

"More secret than all secrets" (guhyād guhyataram) indicates that this knowledge is not hidden but subtle. It requires maturity to receive. The secret is not kept from us but awaits our capacity to understand. The Gita has been available for millennia; its secret opens only to those who are ready.`

    translation: 'Hear again My supreme word, the most secret of all. Because you are dear to Me, I shall tell you what is for your good.',
    commentary: `Before the final teaching, Krishna speaks from love: "Because you are dear to Me" (iṣṭo'si me dṛḍham). This is not teacher to student but friend to friend, lover to beloved. The Gita's ultimate teachings come wrapped in divine affection.

Shankaracharya notes that Krishna says "again" (bhūyaḥ)—this supreme truth has been said before but bears repeating. Truth is not grasped once and done. It must be heard again and again until it saturates being. Each hearing deepens; each repetition reveals new dimensions.

"For your good" (te hitam)—Krishna's motivation is solely Arjuna's welfare. This is the nature of true teaching: given freely, without agenda, purely for the benefit of the recipient. The Divine wants nothing from us; it only wants for us—our freedom, our peace, our return to wholeness.`

    translation: 'Abandoning all dharmas, take refuge in Me alone. I shall liberate you from all sins; do not grieve.',
    commentary: `This is the Gita's ultimate verse—the charama shloka, the final word. "Abandon all dharmas" (sarva-dharmān parityajya)—even righteous duties, even religious obligations—and take refuge in Me alone (mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja). The promise: I will liberate you from all sins. Do not grieve (mā śucaḥ).

Shankaracharya interprets "abandon all dharmas" not as license for immorality but as transcending the very framework of dharma and adharma. Beyond good and evil is the Supreme—and to reach that Supreme, even attachment to virtue must be released. This is not moral relativism but the final surrender.

For those weighed down by guilt, regret, or fear of inadequacy, this verse offers radical grace. Whatever you have done or failed to do, whatever sins burden you—surrender to the Divine, and you will be freed. This is not earned but received. The only requirement is complete, unconditional surrender. Do not grieve—liberation is assured to the one who truly takes refuge.`

    translation: 'This should never be spoken by you to one who is devoid of austerity, nor to one who is not devoted, nor to one who does not render service, nor to one who speaks ill of Me.',
    commentary: `Krishna gives guidelines for sharing this teaching: not to the undisciplined (atapaska), the undevoted (abhakta), those unwilling to serve (aśuśrūṣave), or those hostile to the Divine (yo mām abhyasūyati). This is not spiritual elitism but practical wisdom about readiness.

From the Advaitic view, the teaching cannot be forced on unprepared minds. Without discipline, the mind cannot sustain the understanding. Without devotion, the heart remains closed. Without service, ego remains entrenched. Without respect for the sacred, cynicism corrupts what is received.

This guidance applies to all who would share wisdom. Cast not pearls before swine—not because some are unworthy, but because unpreparedness wastes opportunity and may even create harm. The teaching is for those ready to receive it; others must first ripen through their own process.`

    translation: 'One who teaches this supreme secret to My devotees, having shown supreme devotion to Me, shall without doubt come to Me.',
    commentary: `To those who share this teaching with devotees—"without doubt" (asaṁśayaḥ) they will attain the Divine. Teaching becomes a form of devotion; sharing wisdom is itself a path to liberation. The Gita encourages not hoarding truth but transmitting it.

Shankaracharya notes that the condition is sharing with "My devotees" (mad-bhakteṣu)—those who are ready and receptive. Teaching the willing is service to the Divine. Through such service, the teacher's own understanding deepens and their bond with the Divine strengthens.

This verse honors the tradition of transmission that has kept the Gita alive for millennia—teacher to student, generation to generation. Each person who shares this wisdom participates in a sacred lineage and draws closer to the source. Teaching is not giving away what we have but deepening our connection to the infinite.`

    commentary: `Krishna declares that those who teach this wisdom are "dearest" (priyatama) to Him—none dearer among humans, now or in the future. This extraordinary promise elevates spiritual teaching to the highest form of service.

From the Advaitic standpoint, why is teaching so valued? Because it multiplies liberation. One liberated person has freed themselves; one who teaches may free many. The ripple effects extend across generations. Krishna values this not for His benefit but because it serves the liberation of beings.

This verse inspires and humbles those who teach spiritual truths. The Divine particularly loves those who share wisdom. But with this love comes responsibility—to teach with care, to ensure readiness, to transmit faithfully. The teacher serves as bridge between the Divine and those seeking.`

    commentary: `Even studying this dialogue is worship. "Sacrifice of knowledge" (jñāna-yajña)—the Gita itself becomes the offering, the fire, and the deity. Reading, contemplating, studying this text is a form of worship that pleases the Divine.

Shankaracharya explains that jñāna-yajña was declared the highest sacrifice in Chapter 4. Here Krishna confirms that engaging with the Gita itself constitutes this supreme offering. No external ritual is needed; attentive study is the ritual.

This verse encourages continuous engagement with the text. The Gita is not read once and mastered. It is returned to again and again, each reading revealing new depths. This ongoing study is worship—communion with the Divine through the vehicle of sacred words.`

    commentary: `Arjuna's transformation is complete. "Delusion destroyed" (naṣṭo mohaḥ)—the confusion that paralyzed him in Chapter 1 is gone. "Memory gained" (smṛtir labdhā)—he remembers who he truly is. "Through Your grace" (tvat-prasādāt)—acknowledging that this clarity came not from his effort alone but from divine gift.

From the Advaitic standpoint, "memory" here means remembrance of the Self—the recognition that was always present but obscured by moha (delusion). The Self was never lost, only forgotten. Krishna's teaching awakened what was always there.

"I shall do Your bidding" (kariṣye vacanaṁ tava)—Arjuna will now fight, but from a completely different place. Not from confusion, not from desire for victory, not from hatred of enemies—but from clear understanding of duty and complete surrender to the Divine will. The same action, utterly transformed by the state from which it arises.`

From the Advaitic view, Sanjaya represents every sincere listener. Though he did not participate in the dialogue, he received its benefit fully. This suggests that the Gita's power extends to all who approach it with openness—we need not be Arjuna, just attentive.

"Great-souled" (mahātmanaḥ) applies to Arjuna, but by extension to all who undergo such transformation. The one who receives divine teaching and acts upon it becomes mahātma—great-souled. The Gita offers this possibility to every reader.`

Shankaracharya notes that "Lord of Yoga" (Yogeśvara) describes Krishna as the master of all yogas—karma, jnana, bhakti, all paths. The teaching Sanjaya heard encompasses them all, integrated in the person of Krishna who embodies their synthesis.

"Directly" (sākṣāt) emphasizes immediacy. Though Sanjaya was not physically present, Vyasa's gift allowed him to hear as if present. This points to how the Gita can speak directly to us across millennia—through the grace of the tradition, the text becomes living voice.`

From the Advaitic standpoint, this describes the proper relationship with sacred teaching. It is not information to be acquired and filed away but a living spring to be returned to. Each return refreshes; each remembrance reveals what was not seen before.

Sanjaya models how to relate to the Gita. Read it, contemplate it, return to it. Let it be a source of ongoing rejoicing. The dialogue between Keshava (Krishna) and Arjuna is "puṇya"—sacred, holy, merit-generating. Simply engaging with it purifies and uplifts.`

This is not wish but conviction (mati).

From the Advaitic standpoint, this verse has universal application. Krishna represents the divine principle accessible in each heart; Arjuna represents the individual who turns toward that principle and acts accordingly. When these come together—in anyone, anywhere—success is assured.

This is the Gita's final promise: align with the Divine, act from that alignment, and results will be auspicious. Not necessarily what ego wants, but what is truly good—fortune, victory, prosperity, righteousness. The bow-wielding Arjuna who began in despair ends as the emblem of assured success. So may it be for all who walk this path.`
