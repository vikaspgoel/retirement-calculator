    transliteration: 'arjuna uvāca\nsannyāsaṁ karmaṇāṁ kṛṣṇa punar yogaṁ ca śaṁsasi\nyac chreya etayor ekaṁ tan me brūhi su-niścitam',
    translation: 'Arjuna said: O Krishna, you praise renunciation of actions and also yoga of action. Tell me decisively which one of these two is better.',
    commentary: `Arjuna's question is practical: stop confusing me with apparently contradictory advice! You praise both giving up action (sannyasa) and performing action (yoga). Which is actually better? Tell me one thing, clearly.

This question reflects genuine confusion that many seekers face. Teachers seem to advocate both engagement and withdrawal, both doing and non-doing. Arjuna wants clarity, not more paradox.

Krishna's answer will clarify that both paths lead to the same goal, but yoga of action is more accessible for most people. The apparent contradiction dissolves when we understand that true renunciation is internal, not external—and internal renunciation is compatible with outward action.`

    sanskrit: 'श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nसंन्यासः कर्मयोगश्च निःश्रेयसकरावुभौ |\nतयोस्तु कर्मसंन्यासात्कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nsannyāsaḥ karma-yogaś ca niḥśreyasa-karāv ubhau\ntayos tu karma-sannyāsāt karma-yogo viśiṣyate',
    translation: 'The Lord said: Both renunciation and yoga of action lead to the highest good. But of the two, yoga of action is superior to renunciation of action.',
    commentary: `Krishna's answer is direct: both paths lead to liberation (niḥśreyasa). But karma yoga is "superior" (viśiṣyate)—not because its goal is higher but because it's more practical and less prone to error.

Shankaracharya clarifies that superiority here means accessibility. Formal renunciation (sannyasa) requires extraordinary qualifications; without them, it becomes pretense. Karma yoga is available to everyone and less likely to produce spiritual bypassing.

This answers Arjuna's either/or question with a both/and: both work, but one is easier and safer for most. For Arjuna specifically—a warrior, a householder, a man of action—karma yoga is clearly the better fit. The teaching honors different paths while giving practical guidance.`

    sanskrit: 'ज्ञेयः स नित्यसंन्यासी यो न द्वेष्टि न काङ्क्षति |\nनिर्द्वन्द्वो हि महाबाहो सुखं बन्धात्प्रमुच्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'jñeyaḥ sa nitya-sannyāsī yo na dveṣṭi na kāṅkṣati\nnirdvandvo hi mahā-bāho sukhaṁ bandhāt pramucyate',
    translation: 'One who neither hates nor desires should be known as a constant renunciate. Free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed, they are easily released from bondage.',
    commentary: `True renunciation is defined not by externals but by psychology: neither hating nor desiring (na dveṣṭi na kāṅkṣati). Such a person is always a sannyasi (nitya-sannyāsī), regardless of outer circumstance. Free from duality, they are easily liberated.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that this inner sannyasa is what matters. The formal robes mean nothing if the mind still grasps and rejects. Conversely, full external engagement is compatible with inner renunciation if attachment is absent.

"Free from pairs of opposites" (nirdvandva) means released from the reactive swings—pleasure/pain, success/failure, praise/blame. Such a person has found center. From that stability, liberation is "easy" (sukham) because the principal obstacle—reactive attachment—is already overcome.`

    transliteration: 'sāṅkhya-yogau pṛthag bālāḥ pravadanti na paṇḍitāḥ\nekam apy āsthitaḥ samyag ubhayor vindate phalam',
    translation: 'Children, not the wise, speak of Sankhya and Yoga as different. One who is well established in either obtains the fruit of both.',
    commentary: `A sharp observation: only the immature (bālāḥ) see knowledge-path and action-path as separate. The wise know they converge. Properly followed, either path gives the fruit of both—because the fruit is the same: liberation.

From the Advaitic standpoint, Sankhya (knowledge/discrimination) and Yoga (action/practice) are two approaches to one reality. The jnani who discriminates Self from not-Self and the karma yogi who acts without attachment both arrive at the same recognition: the Self is actionless, unchanging, free.

This verse dissolves sectarian debates. "My path is better than yours" reveals spiritual adolescence. The mature see that different temperaments require different approaches, but the destination is one. Fight about methods if you haven't arrived; those who have arrived don't argue.`

    transliteration: 'sannyāsas tu mahā-bāho duḥkham āptum ayogataḥ\nyoga-yukto munir brahma na cireṇādhigacchati',
    translation: 'But renunciation, O mighty-armed, is difficult to attain without yoga. The sage united with yoga reaches Brahman before long.',
    commentary: `A practical warning: sannyasa without yoga (action discipline) is hard to achieve and prone to failure. But the sage who combines understanding with practice reaches Brahman "not long" from now (na cireṇa)—quickly, by comparison.

Shankaracharya explains that yoga purifies the mind and prepares for renunciation. Jumping to formal sannyasa without this preparation leaves the mind unprepared for its demands. The result is often failure—either falling back into worldly involvement or becoming a hypocritical performer of renunciation.

"United with yoga" (yoga-yukta) suggests the combination: karma yoga as preparation, leading naturally to the inner sannyasa that is stable and authentic. This is not a criticism of formal renunciation but a recognition that it works best when properly prepared.`

    transliteration: 'yoga-yukto viśuddhātmā vijitātmā jitendriyaḥ\nsarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā kurvann api na lipyate',
    translation: 'One united with yoga, of purified self, self-conquered, sense-conquered, whose self has become the self of all beings—though acting, is not tainted.',
    commentary: `Description of the liberated actor: united with yoga, purified (viśuddha), self-mastered (vijitātmā), sense-controlled (jitendriya), and—most remarkably—"whose self has become the self of all beings." Such a one acts without acquiring karma's taint.

The phrase "sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā" is significant: the yogi's self has expanded to include all selves. This is not metaphor but experience. When the sense of separate self dissolves, what remains is the one Self present in all. How can such a one harm or be harmed?

"Though acting, not tainted" (kurvann api na lipyate) is the fruit of karma yoga perfected. Action continues—perhaps vigorous, effective action—but nothing sticks. Like water on a lotus leaf, experience happens but leaves no residue. This is freedom in the midst of life.`

    transliteration: 'naiva kiñcit karomīti yukto manyeta tattva-vit\npaśyañ śṛṇvan spṛśañ jighrann aśnan gacchan svapañ śvasan',
    translation: '"I do nothing at all"—thus should the truth-knower think, steadfast, while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing...',
    commentary: `The vision of the wise: "I do nothing" (naiva kiñcit karomi). While the body sees, hears, touches, smells, eats, moves, sleeps, breathes—all these continue, but the knower recognizes: the Self is not the doer. Actions happen; I witness.

Shankaracharya explains that this is not verbal formula but direct recognition. The tattva-vit (truth-knower) sees that all activity belongs to prakriti (nature), not to the Self. The senses engage their objects; the Self remains uninvolved. This seeing is liberation.

The list of activities is comprehensive and mundane: seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, breathing. These are not extraordinary acts but daily functions. The teaching applies to ordinary life. Even while brushing teeth, the wise one recognizes: "I am not doing this. The body is functioning; I am awareness."`

    translation: '...speaking, letting go, grasping, opening and closing the eyes—convinced that the senses operate among sense objects.',
    commentary: `The list continues: speaking, releasing, grasping, opening and closing eyes. Even these fine movements are seen as senses operating among their objects. The Self simply witnesses the natural function of the apparatus.

"Convinced" (dhārayan) indicates this is not occasional insight but sustained understanding. The wise one maintains this recognition throughout activity. It becomes the default perspective, not a special meditative state.

This teaching can be practiced: observe any action and notice—is there really an "I" doing it, or is there simply happening? The hand reaches; is "I" reaching or is reaching occurring? This investigation, sustained, reveals the absence of doer and liberates from the burden of agency.`

  // Offering actions to Brahman

    verse: 10,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['surrender', 'detachment'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'ब्रह्मण्याधाय कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा करोति यः |\nलिप्यते न स पापेन पद्मपत्रमिवाम्भसा ||',
    transliteration: 'brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā karoti yaḥ\nlipyate na sa pāpena padma-patram ivāmbhasā',
    translation: 'One who acts, placing all actions in Brahman, abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin, like a lotus leaf by water.',
    commentary: `The lotus leaf simile: water touches it but does not stick; it remains dry while in the water. Similarly, one who offers all actions to Brahman (brahmaṇy ādhāya) and abandons attachment (saṅgaṁ tyaktvā) is not tainted by sin—actions touch but do not stick.

Shankaracharya explains that "placing in Brahman" means recognizing all activity as Brahman's play, not personal accomplishment. When the sense of personal doership dissolves into the recognition of cosmic functioning, karma loses its binding power.

This is the bhakti-jnana synthesis in action: offering (bhakti) with understanding (jnana). Not mechanical offering but genuine recognition that actions arise from and return to the One. In that recognition, sin—which requires a sinner—cannot take root. Who would be tainted?`

    transliteration: 'yuktaḥ karma-phalaṁ tyaktvā śāntim āpnoti naiṣṭhikīm\nayuktaḥ kāma-kāreṇa phale sakto nibadhyate',
    translation: 'The disciplined one, renouncing the fruit of action, attains lasting peace. The undisciplined, attached to fruit through desire, is bound.',
    commentary: `Two trajectories contrasted: the disciplined (yukta) renounces fruit and attains lasting peace (śāntim naiṣṭhikīm). The undisciplined (ayukta), driven by desire and attached to results, is bound. Same world, same actions, opposite outcomes based on inner orientation.

"Lasting peace" (naiṣṭhikī śānti) means peace that doesn't depend on circumstances. Circumstantial peace comes and goes with success and failure; lasting peace remains regardless. This is possible only when attachment to outcomes releases.

The mechanism is clear: attachment to fruit means the outcome determines one's state. Success brings elation, failure brings depression. Release attachment, and outcomes become information rather than verdicts. This is freedom—not from life but in life.`

    transliteration: 'sarva-karmāṇi manasā sannyasyāste sukhaṁ vaśī\nnava-dvāre pure dehī naiva kurvan na kārayan',
    translation: 'Mentally renouncing all actions, the self-controlled embodied one rests happily in the city of nine gates, neither acting nor causing action.',
    commentary: `The body is the "city of nine gates" (nava-dvāre pure)—seven in the head (two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, mouth) plus two below. The Self dwells there as witness, having mentally renounced all actions, neither doing nor causing, resting happily.

Shankaracharya emphasizes "mentally" (manasā)—the renunciation is internal. The body continues its functions; the mind has let go of ownership. The dehī (embodied one) is described as resting (āste) happily (sukham)—at ease, not striving.

This image suggests that even while identified with a body, the wise one knows themselves as witness-resident, not the city itself. The gates open and close, experiences enter and exit, but the one who dwells there is untouched, content, complete.`

    transliteration: 'vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe gavi hastini\nśuni caiva śvapāke ca paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ',
    translation: 'The wise see with equal vision a learned and humble Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and an outcaste.',
    commentary: `The famous equal vision verse: sages see the same in a learned Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a "dog-cooker" (outcaste). The social hierarchy, the species hierarchy—all dissolve in sama-darśana, equal seeing.

Shankaracharya clarifies that this is not ethical equalization (treat a dog like a Brahmin in behavior) but ontological recognition: the same Self dwells in all. Forms differ vastly; essence is one. The wise see the essence while acknowledging the form.

This vision is the fruit of karma yoga perfected. When the sense of separate self dissolves, what remains is consciousness—and consciousness is the same everywhere it appears. The differences are costume; the actor is one. Seeing this, hierarchy loses its ultimate significance.`

    transliteration: 'ihaiva tair jitaḥ sargo yeṣāṁ sāmye sthitaṁ manaḥ\nnirdoṣaṁ hi samaṁ brahma tasmād brahmaṇi te sthitāḥ',
    translation: 'Here itself, creation is conquered by those whose mind is established in equality. Brahman is flawless and equal; therefore they are established in Brahman.',
    commentary: `Those with minds established in equality (sāmye sthitam manaḥ) have conquered creation (sarga) here and now—not after death but in this life. Why? Because Brahman is flawless (nirdoṣam) and equal (samam)—and they have become like Brahman.

Shankaracharya explains that "conquering creation" means transcending the duality of samsara. When the mind no longer distinguishes high from low, desirable from undesirable, the web of creation loses its entangling power. The differentiated world remains visible but no longer binds.

"Established in Brahman" (brahmaṇi sthitāḥ) is the result of equal vision. By seeing the same everywhere, one has aligned with Brahman's nature—which is undifferentiated, pure, equal. Like recognizes like; the equal mind recognizes equal Brahman and merges.`

    translation: 'With the self unattached to external contacts, one finds the happiness that is in the Self. Such a one, with self united to Brahman through yoga, attains imperishable happiness.',
    commentary: `The source of true happiness is revealed: not in external contacts (bāhya-sparśa) but in the Self (ātmani). The one unattached to externals finds inner happiness and, united with Brahman, enjoys imperishable bliss (sukham akṣayam).

Shankaracharya notes the contrast: external pleasures are perishable, dependent on contact and conditions. Self-happiness is akṣaya—undecaying, not subject to loss. It is not produced by anything, so nothing can destroy it.

This addresses a deep human concern: where can I find lasting happiness? The answer: not in objects, achievements, or relationships, which come and go—but in your own Self, which is always present. Turn attention inward, release external grasping, and discover the happiness that was always there.`

    translation: 'The pleasures born of contact are wombs of suffering only. They have a beginning and an end, O son of Kunti. The wise do not delight in them.',
    commentary: `A stark assessment: contact-born pleasures (saṁsparśa-jā bhogāḥ) are "wombs of suffering" (duḥkha-yonayaḥ). They have beginnings and ends—and when they end, suffering follows. The wise recognize this and do not invest in them.

Shankaracharya explains the mechanism: every pleasure that arises from contact must cease when contact ends. The anticipation of ending creates anxiety; the actual ending creates loss. Even during the pleasure, there is subtle suffering in the impermanence. The wise see this and seek elsewhere.

This is not pessimism but realism. Sensory pleasures are not condemned as evil but recognized as unreliable. The wise enjoy what comes without expecting it to last or chasing it when it goes. This is the middle way between indulgence and rejection.`

Shankaracharya sees this as describing the accomplished state. The yogi no longer depends on external sources for happiness, pleasure, or illumination. All three are found within. From this fullness, nothing is needed from outside.

"Having become Brahman" (brahma-bhūta) indicates identity, not absorption. The yogi recognizes what was always true: "I am Brahman." There is no merging or transformation but recognition. What is recognized is Brahman; what recognizes is Brahman. Subject and object dissolve in identity.`

    translation: 'Knowing Me as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all worlds, and the friend of all beings—one attains peace.',
    commentary: `The chapter concludes with three aspects of Krishna: enjoyer (bhoktā) of all offerings, great Lord (mahā-īśvara) of all worlds, and friend (suhṛd) of all beings. Knowing this, one attains peace (śāntim ṛcchati).

Shankaracharya sees these as correcting misunderstandings. Krishna is not distant but receives all offerings—the appropriate recipient of worship. He is not powerless but the Lord of all worlds. He is not indifferent but the friend of all beings—not just devotees, but all.

"Friend of all beings" (suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām) is particularly significant. The Divine is not judge or punisher but friend—wishing well, supporting, accompanying. This knowledge brings peace because it dissolves the alienation that makes existence feel hostile. The universe is friendly because its Lord is our friend.`
