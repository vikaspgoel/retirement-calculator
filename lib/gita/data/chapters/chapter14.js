    sanskrit: 'श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nपरं भूयः प्रवक्ष्यामि ज्ञानानां ज्ञानमुत्तमम् |\nयज्ज्ञात्वा मुनयः सर्वे परां सिद्धिमितो गताः ||',
    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nparaṁ bhūyaḥ pravakṣyāmi jñānānāṁ jñānam uttamam\nyaj jñātvā munayaḥ sarve parāṁ siddhim ito gatāḥ',
    translation: 'The Lord said: I shall again declare the supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained the highest perfection.',
    commentary: `Krishna introduces guna-knowledge as "the best of all knowledge" (jñānānāṁ jñānam uttamam). By this knowledge, all sages (munayaḥ sarve) have attained perfection. This establishes the importance of understanding the gunas.

Knowing the gunas means understanding the mechanics of bondage. The gunas are the forces that bind the Self to the field; knowing how they work is knowing how bondage happens. This knowledge enables liberation.

"All the sages" indicates universal validity. This is not sectarian knowledge but the common attainment of the wise across traditions. Whoever understands the gunas understands a universal truth.`

    themes: ['ignorance', 'knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'सत्त्वं रजस्तम इति गुणाः प्रकृतिसम्भवाः |\nनिबध्नन्ति महाबाहो देहे देहिनमव्ययम् ||',
    transliteration: 'sattvaṁ rajas tama iti guṇāḥ prakṛti-sambhavāḥ\nnibadhnanti mahā-bāho dehe dehinam avyayam',
    translation: 'Sattva, rajas, and tamas—these gunas born of prakriti bind the imperishable embodied one to the body, O mighty-armed.',
    commentary: `The core teaching: sattva, rajas, and tamas—qualities born of prakriti—bind (nibadhnanti) the imperishable Self (dehinam avyayam) to the body. The Self is not bound by nature but by identification with nature's qualities.

"Imperishable" (avyayam) reminds us that the bound one is inherently free. The bondage is not essential but adventitious—it happens through ignorance, not through the Self's nature. What is bound can be unbound.

The three gunas are not evil; they are simply the constituents of nature. But identification with them, mistaking their movements for the Self's action, creates bondage. The solution is not to destroy the gunas but to dis-identify.`

    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['peace', 'ignorance'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'तत्र सत्त्वं निर्मलत्वात्प्रकाशकमनामयम् |\nसुखसङ्गेन बध्नाति ज्ञानसङ्गेन चानघ ||',
    transliteration: 'tatra sattvaṁ nirmalatvāt prakāśakam anāmayam\nsukha-saṅgena badhnāti jñāna-saṅgena cānagha',
    translation: 'Of these, sattva, being pure, is illuminating and healthy. It binds through attachment to happiness and through attachment to knowledge, O sinless one.',
    commentary: `Sattva seems good—it's pure (nirmala), illuminating (prakāśaka), healthy (anāmaya). But even sattva binds! It binds through attachment to happiness (sukha-saṅgena) and knowledge (jñāna-saṅgena).

This is subtle: the spiritual seeker attached to peace, clarity, and understanding is still bound. Sattva is the golden chain—more comfortable than iron but still a chain. The goal is freedom from all gunas, not refinement of bondage.

Many spiritual paths stop at sattva, mistaking peace for liberation. But "I am a peaceful person" or "I am knowledgeable" is still identification with a guna. True freedom is beyond even these refined states.`

  // Rajas binds through action

    verse: 7,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q1', 'Q3'],
    themes: ['desire', 'action'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'रजो रागात्मकं विद्धि तृष्णासङ्गसमुद्भवम् |\nतन्निबध्नाति कौन्तेय कर्मसङ्गेन देहिनम् ||',
    transliteration: 'rajo rāgātmakaṁ viddhi tṛṣṇā-saṅga-samudbhavam\ntan nibadhnāti kaunteya karma-saṅgena dehinam',
    translation: 'Know rajas to be of the nature of passion, born of craving and attachment. It binds the embodied one through attachment to action, O son of Kunti.',
    commentary: `Rajas is passion (rāga), craving (tṛṣṇā), attachment (saṅga). It binds through attachment to action (karma-saṅgena). The rajasic person is driven to do, achieve, acquire, experience—always restless, never satisfied.

This is the most common state in worldly life. The feeling that "I must do something," the inability to rest, the constant pursuit—all are rajas. Even spiritual ambition can be rajasic: "I must achieve enlightenment!"

Rajas is necessary for action in the world, but identification with it creates bondage. The enlightened may be very active, but they are not attached to action; they act from clarity, not craving.`

  // Tamas binds through ignorance

    id: 'bg-14-8',

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'तमस्त्वज्ञानजं विद्धि मोहनं सर्वदेहिनाम् |\nप्रमादालस्यनिद्राभिस्तन्निबध्नाति भारत ||',
    transliteration: 'tamas tv ajñāna-jaṁ viddhi mohanaṁ sarva-dehinām\npramādālasya-nidrābhis tan nibadhnāti bhārata',
    translation: 'Know tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings. It binds through negligence, laziness, and sleep, O Bharata.',
    commentary: `Tamas is born of ignorance (ajñāna-ja), causing delusion (mohana). It binds through negligence (pramāda), laziness (ālasya), and sleep (nidrā). The tamasic state is dull, unconscious, resistant to change.

Tamas is not just tiredness but active ignorance—the preference for not knowing, not seeing, not growing. Denial, avoidance, and willful blindness are tamasic. So is the inertia that says "maybe tomorrow."

Sleep is mentioned because excess sleep is tamasic, but also because tamas is a kind of spiritual sleep—being unconscious while technically awake. The tamasic person goes through life without really being present.`

  // Which guna dominates

    sanskrit: 'रजस्तमश्चाभिभूय सत्त्वं भवति भारत |\nरजः सत्त्वं तमश्चैव तमः सत्त्वं रजस्तथा ||',
    transliteration: 'rajas tamaś cābhibhūya sattvaṁ bhavati bhārata\nrajaḥ sattvaṁ tamaś caiva tamaḥ sattvaṁ rajas tathā',
    translation: 'Sattva arises by overpowering rajas and tamas, O Bharata; rajas by overpowering sattva and tamas; and tamas by overpowering sattva and rajas.',
    commentary: `The gunas are in constant flux, each arising by overpowering the others. At any moment, one dominates while the others subside. Our experience fluctuates accordingly—sometimes clear, sometimes driven, sometimes dull.

Understanding this dynamic helps with self-observation. "I feel lazy" becomes "tamas is dominant right now." This objectifies the state rather than identifying with it. The observer watches the gunas play.

This also explains mood swings and inconsistency. We're not failing when we shift from clarity to dullness; we're experiencing guna-flux. The goal is not to rigidly maintain one guna but to transcend the whole system.`

    sanskrit: 'सर्वद्वारेषु देहेऽस्मिन्प्रकाश उपजायते |\nज्ञानं यदा तदा विद्याद्विवृद्धं सत्त्वमित्युत ||',
    transliteration: 'sarva-dvāreṣu dehe\'smin prakāśa upajāyate\njñānaṁ yadā tadā vidyād vivṛddhaṁ sattvam ity uta',
    translation: 'When light and knowledge arise in all the gates of this body, then one should know that sattva has increased.',
    commentary: `The sign of sattva: light (prakāśa) and knowledge (jñānam) in all the "gates" (senses) of the body. The senses become clear, perception becomes sharp, understanding comes easily. Everything seems illuminated.

"All the gates" suggests that sattva affects the whole system. It's not just intellectual clarity but perceptual clarity—seeing more, hearing more, understanding more. The world seems brighter, more meaningful.

Recognizing this sign helps self-diagnosis. When you feel clear and knowledgeable, sattva is dominant. Use this time for spiritual practice and study; the conditions are favorable.`

    sanskrit: 'लोभः प्रवृत्तिरारम्भः कर्मणामशमः स्पृहा |\nरजस्येतानि जायन्ते विवृद्धे भरतर्षभ ||',
    transliteration: 'lobhaḥ pravṛttir ārambhaḥ karmaṇām aśamaḥ spṛhā\nrajasy etāni jāyante vivṛddhe bharatarṣabha',
    translation: 'Greed, activity, undertaking of actions, restlessness, desire—these arise when rajas increases, O best of Bharatas.',
    commentary: `Signs of rajas: greed (lobha), activity (pravṛtti), initiating actions (ārambha), restlessness (aśama), desire (spṛhā). The rajasic state is characterized by wanting and doing—never enough, never at rest.

These signs help recognize rajas in oneself. "I feel driven to do something—anything." "I can't stop thinking about what I want." "I'm restless and dissatisfied." These indicate rajas is dominant.

Rajas is not all bad—it provides the energy for action. But unrecognized, it creates exhaustion and frustration. The rajasic person achieves but never enjoys; accomplishes but never rests.`

    transliteration: 'aprakāśo\'pravṛttiś ca pramādo moha eva ca\ntamasy etāni jāyante vivṛddhe kuru-nandana',
    translation: 'Darkness, inactivity, negligence, and delusion—these arise when tamas increases, O joy of the Kurus.',
    commentary: `Signs of tamas: darkness (aprakāśa), inactivity (apravṛtti), negligence (pramāda), delusion (moha). The tamasic state is characterized by not-seeing and not-doing—fog, confusion, inertia.

"I don't feel like doing anything." "I can't think clearly." "I keep forgetting important things." "I don't understand what's happening." These indicate tamas is dominant.

Tamas is the state of spiritual sleep. The remedy is not rajasic forcing (that creates exhaustion) but gentle stimulation of sattva—light, fresh air, good company, inspiring teachings. Gradually, the fog lifts.`

    transliteration: 'arjuna uvāca\nkair liṅgais trīn guṇān etān atīto bhavati prabho\nkim ācāraḥ kathaṁ caitāṁs trīn guṇān ativartate',
    translation: 'Arjuna said: By what marks is one known who has transcended these three gunas, O Lord? How does such a one behave, and how does one transcend these three gunas?',
    commentary: `Arjuna asks three practical questions: What are the signs (marks) of one who has transcended the gunas? How do they behave? And how does one transcend? These questions move from recognition to practice.

The first question allows identification of the enlightened. The second shows what enlightened life looks like. The third provides a path. Together, they complete the teaching.

Arjuna's questions are always practical. He doesn't ask abstract philosophical questions but "what does this mean for living?" This is the warrior's approach—cut to what matters.`

    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nprakāśaṁ ca pravṛttiṁ ca moham eva ca pāṇḍava\nna dveṣṭi sampravṛttāni na nivṛttāni kāṅkṣati',
    translation: 'The Lord said: One who does not hate light, activity, or delusion when they arise, O Pandava, nor longs for them when they cease...',
    commentary: `The first sign: the transcendent one doesn't hate the gunas when they arise (na dveṣṭi sampravṛttāni) nor longs for them when they cease (na nivṛttāni kāṅkṣati). Complete equanimity toward all three.

This is radical non-resistance. When sattva (light), rajas (activity), or tamas (delusion) arise, the wise one doesn't fight. When they cease, no grasping. The gunas play; the witness watches without preference.

This is different from indifference. The wise one is aware, clear, responsive—but not reactive. The gunas come and go like weather; the sky remains untouched.`

    translation: '...who sits like one unconcerned, undisturbed by the gunas, who remains knowing that the gunas alone are operating, and stands firm, unwavering...',
    commentary: `More signs: sits "unconcerned" (udāsīna-vad āsīna), undisturbed by gunas (na vicālyate), knowing "the gunas alone are operating" (guṇā vartanta ity eva), standing firm (avatiṣṭhati), unwavering (na iṅgate).

"Unconcerned" doesn't mean not caring but not being invested in outcomes. The wise one participates in life without making it personal. Things happen; the witness observes.

"The gunas alone are operating" is key recognition. When anger arises, it's rajas operating. When laziness appears, it's tamas. When clarity dawns, it's sattva. None of it is "me." This insight transforms experience.`

    translation: 'And one who serves Me with unwavering devotion-yoga transcends these gunas and becomes fit for becoming Brahman.',
    commentary: `The method of transcendence: "unwavering devotion-yoga" (avyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena) to Krishna. Through such devotion, one transcends the gunas (guṇān samatītya) and becomes fit for Brahman (brahma-bhūyāya kalpate).

This is the chapter's culmination: knowledge of the gunas prepares; devotion transcends. Understanding the mechanism of bondage is helpful, but love for Krishna is what liberates. Jnana and bhakti unite.

"Unwavering" (avyabhicārena) means consistent, not distracted by other loves. Single-pointed devotion to Krishna—not split between God and worldly attachments—is the key. This devotion naturally loosens the gunas' grip.`
