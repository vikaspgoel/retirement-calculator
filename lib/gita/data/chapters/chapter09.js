    verse: 1,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'hope'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nइदं तु ते गुह्यतमं प्रवक्ष्याम्यनसूयवे |\nज्ञानं विज्ञानसहितं यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् ||',
    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nidaṁ tu te guhyatamaṁ pravakṣyāmy anasūyave\njñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ yaj jñātvā mokṣyase\'śubhāt',
    translation: 'The Lord said: To you who are free from envy, I shall declare this most secret knowledge together with realization, knowing which you will be freed from evil.',
    commentary: `Krishna announces the supreme secret (guhyatamam)—the most confidential knowledge. He shares it because Arjuna is "free from envy" (anasūyave)—receptive, not resentful of another's gifts. This knowledge with realization liberates from evil (aśubhāt).

The qualification is significant: freedom from envy. The envious cannot receive wisdom; they resist what challenges their self-image. Arjuna's openness makes him fit for the highest teaching.

"Knowledge with realization" (jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ) distinguishes theoretical understanding from lived experience. This chapter offers both—concepts to understand and practices that make understanding real.`

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'peace'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'राजविद्या राजगुह्यं पवित्रमिदमुत्तमम् |\nप्रत्यक्षावगमं धर्म्यं सुसुखं कर्तुमव्ययम् ||',
    transliteration: 'rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyaṁ pavitram idam uttamam\npratyakṣāvagamaṁ dharmyaṁ su-sukhaṁ kartum avyayam',
    translation: 'This is the king of knowledge, the king of secrets, the supreme purifier. It is realized by direct experience, righteous, very easy to practice, and imperishable.',
    commentary: `The teaching's attributes: rāja-vidyā (king of knowledge), rāja-guhya (king of secrets), uttamam (supreme), pavitra (purifier), pratyakṣāvagama (directly experienceable), dharmya (righteous), su-sukha (very easy), avyaya (imperishable).

"Very easy to practice" (su-sukhaṁ kartum) is surprising. We expect spiritual knowledge to be difficult. But Krishna says bhakti—loving devotion—is the easiest path. It requires no special qualifications, no intellectual brilliance, just sincere love.

"Directly experienceable" (pratyakṣāvagama) means this is not mere belief but verifiable realization. Practice it, and you will know directly. The proof is in the pudding—try devotion and see.`

    verse: 4,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'मया ततमिदं सर्वं जगदव्यक्तमूर्तिना |\nमत्स्थानि सर्वभूतानि न चाहं तेष्ववस्थितः ||',
    transliteration: 'mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā\nmat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ',
    translation: 'By Me, in My unmanifested form, all this universe is pervaded. All beings exist in Me, but I do not exist in them.',
    commentary: `A profound paradox: Krishna pervades everything in unmanifest form. All beings exist in Him, yet He does not exist in them. He is everywhere yet contained nowhere—infinite consciousness that includes all without being limited to any.

Shankaracharya explains: just as space pervades objects without being affected by them, Krishna pervades beings without being contained or modified. The relationship is asymmetric: they depend on Him; He does not depend on them.

This resolves the pantheism question. The universe is not God, but the universe is in God. Everything participates in divine reality without exhausting it. God is more than the totality of things while being intimate with each thing.`

    verse: 5,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'न च मत्स्थानि भूतानि पश्य मे योगमैश्वरम् |\nभूतभृन्न च भूतस्थो ममात्मा भूतभावनः ||',
    transliteration: 'na ca mat-sthāni bhūtāni paśya me yogam aiśvaram\nbhūta-bhṛn na ca bhūta-stho mamātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ',
    translation: 'And yet beings do not exist in Me—behold My divine yoga! My Self, sustaining beings and bringing them into existence, does not dwell in beings.',
    commentary: `Now the paradox deepens: beings don't exist in Krishna either! First He said they exist in Him; now He says they don't. This is His "divine yoga" (yogam aiśvaram)—the mystery of simultaneous immanence and transcendence.

From the Advaitic view, the apparent contradiction resolves at a higher level. In absolute truth, beings have no independent existence—they are appearances in consciousness. So saying "they exist in Me" and "they don't exist in Me" are both true from different perspectives.

"My Self sustaining beings" indicates that Krishna is the support, source, and cause while remaining uninvolved. Like the sun that makes everything visible without being affected by what it reveals, Krishna enables existence without being bound by it.`

  // All beings return to Krishna
  {
    id: 'bg-9-7',
    chapter: 9,
    verse: 7,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'सर्वभूतानि कौन्तेय प्रकृतिं यान्ति मामिकाम् |\nकल्पक्षये पुनस्तानि कल्पादौ विसृजाम्यहम् ||',
    transliteration: 'sarva-bhūtāni kaunteya prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikām\nkalpa-kṣaye punas tāni kalpādau visṛjāmy aham',
    translation: 'All beings, O son of Kunti, return to My prakriti at the end of a kalpa. At the beginning of a kalpa, I send them forth again.',
    commentary: `Cosmic dissolution and creation: at the end of a kalpa (cosmic cycle), all beings return to Krishna's prakriti—the unmanifest state. At the next kalpa's beginning, He projects them again. This cycle repeats endlessly.

Shankaracharya notes that this establishes Krishna as the material cause (through prakriti) and the efficient cause (through projecting). The universe is not independent creation but Krishna's cyclical manifestation.

This teaching grounds spirituality in cosmic context. Individual lives are moments in vast cycles. Yet each being's journey toward liberation continues across kalpas until completion. Time is enormous; the opportunity is equally vast.`

  // Worship with love
  {
    id: 'bg-9-22',
    chapter: 9,
    verse: 22,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['surrender', 'faith'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते |\nतेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ||',
    transliteration: 'ananyāś cintayanto māṁ ye janāḥ paryupāsate\nteṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham',
    translation: 'Those who worship Me alone, thinking of no other, to those ever-steadfast devotees I provide what they lack and preserve what they have.',
    commentary: `The famous promise: for exclusive devotees (ananya), Krishna provides "yoga" (what they lack) and "kṣema" (preservation of what they have). Complete material and spiritual security is guaranteed to those who worship Him alone.

"Thinking of no other" (ananyāś cintayanto) is the condition—undivided devotion. The devotee doesn't worship other gods, doesn't rely on other supports, doesn't place ultimate faith elsewhere. This exclusivity is met with complete divine care.

This verse has inspired complete surrender across traditions. If Krishna guarantees provision and protection, what is left to worry about? The devotee's job is devotion; Krishna's job is everything else.`

  // Simple offerings accepted with love
  {
    id: 'bg-9-26',
    chapter: 9,
    verse: 26,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3'],
    themes: ['surrender', 'faith'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'पत्रं पुष्पं फलं तोयं यो मे भक्त्या प्रयच्छति |\nतदहं भक्त्युपहृतमश्नामि प्रयतात्मनः ||',
    transliteration: 'patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati\ntad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ',
    translation: 'Whoever offers Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water—that offering of love from the pure-hearted I accept.',
    commentary: `The simplicity of devotion: a leaf, a flower, a fruit, water—the humblest offerings are accepted if given with love (bhaktyā). The value is not in the gift but in the devotion. The poorest person can worship as effectively as the richest.

Shankaracharya emphasizes "from the pure-hearted" (prayatātmanaḥ)—the inner state matters more than the outer gift. A billion-dollar temple built with impure heart is less acceptable than a sincere flower from a devotee.

This democratizes spirituality. No elaborate rituals, no expensive materials, no priestly intermediaries required. Direct relationship, simple offering, pure love—this is accessible to everyone, everywhere, always.`

  // Offer everything to Krishna
  {
    id: 'bg-9-27',
    chapter: 9,
    verse: 27,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['surrender', 'action'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'यत्करोषि यदश्नासि यज्जुहोषि ददासि यत् |\nयत्तपस्यसि कौन्तेय तत्कुरुष्व मदर्पणम् ||',
    transliteration: 'yat karoṣi yad aśnāsi yaj juhoṣi dadāsi yat\nyat tapasyasi kaunteya tat kuruṣva mad-arpaṇam',
    translation: 'Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer, whatever you give, whatever austerity you practice, O son of Kunti, do that as an offering to Me.',
    commentary: `Every activity becomes worship: what you do (work), eat (bodily maintenance), offer (worship), give (charity), practice as austerity—all can be offered to Krishna. Life itself becomes continuous devotion.

This expands the previous verse from ritual to totality. Not just formal offerings but everything—every action, every choice, every moment. Nothing is secular when everything is offered; ordinary life becomes sacred.

This is the practical teaching of karma yoga infused with bhakti. One cannot always be in temple or meditation, but one can always be offering. The remembrance transforms the mundane into the sacred, the routine into the worshipful.`

    verse: 29,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['surrender', 'knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु न मे द्वेष्योऽस्ति न प्रियः |\nये भजन्ति तु मां भक्त्या मयि ते तेषु चाप्यहम् ||',
    transliteration: 'samo\'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo\'sti na priyaḥ\nye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā mayi te teṣu cāpy aham',
    translation: 'I am the same toward all beings; to Me none is hateful nor dear. But those who worship Me with devotion—they are in Me and I am in them.',
    commentary: `Krishna is impartial (samaḥ) toward all—no one is hateful (dveṣya) or specially dear (priya) to Him in the sense of favoritism. Yet those who worship Him with devotion (bhaktyā) have a special relationship: they abide in Him and He in them (mayi te teṣu cāpy aham).

Shankaracharya explains: God does not discriminate by birth or status; the sun shines on all. But devotion creates intimacy—the devotee dwells in Krishna and Krishna in the devotee. This is not partiality but the natural fruit of relationship.

The verse balances transcendence (same to all) with immanence (in the devotee). Krishna is not capricious; He responds to love.`

  // All can approach Krishna
  {
    id: 'bg-9-32',
    chapter: 9,
    verse: 32,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3', 'Q4'],
    themes: ['hope', 'faith'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'मां हि पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य येऽपि स्युः पापयोनयः |\nस्त्रियो वैश्यास्तथा शूद्रास्तेऽपि यान्ति परां गतिम् ||',
    transliteration: 'māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye\'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ\nstriyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās te\'pi yānti parāṁ gatim',
    translation: 'For those who take refuge in Me, O Partha, even if they are of sinful birth—women, vaishyas, shudras—even they attain the supreme goal.',
    commentary: `A revolutionary declaration: even those considered "low" in traditional society—those of "sinful birth," women, merchants, laborers—can reach the supreme goal by taking refuge in Krishna. Birth and social position are no barrier.

This verse was radical in its context, challenging caste exclusivity. Krishna opens the highest goal to everyone without exception. The only qualification is taking refuge (vyapāśritya); all else is irrelevant.

From the universal perspective, this establishes bhakti's democratic nature. Devotion doesn't require learning, status, or gender. The lowliest can reach the highest through love. This is the "easy" aspect of the king of secrets—accessible to all.`

  // Be devoted and you will come to Me
  {
    id: 'bg-9-34',
    chapter: 9,
    verse: 34,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['surrender', 'faith'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु |\nमामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायणः ||',
    transliteration: 'man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru\nmām evaiṣyasi yuktvaivam ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ',
    translation: 'Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, bow to Me. Thus uniting yourself with Me, taking Me as the supreme goal, you will come to Me.',
    commentary: `The chapter concludes with a fourfold instruction: mind on Krishna (man-manā), devoted (mad-bhakta), worshipful (mad-yājī), reverent (māṁ namaskuru). Taking Him as supreme goal (mat-parāyaṇa), one surely comes to Him.

This is the essence of bhakti yoga: simple, direct, total. No complex philosophy, no arduous practices—just orientation of the whole being toward Krishna. Mind, heart, action, and attitude all aligned.

The promise is certain: "You will come to Me" (mām evaiṣyasi). This is not probability but guarantee. Follow the path of devotion, and arrival is assured. The king of secrets is also the king of promises.`
