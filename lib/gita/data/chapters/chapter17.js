    transliteration: 'arjuna uvāca\nye śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ\nteṣāṁ niṣṭhā tu kā kṛṣṇa sattvam āho rajas tamaḥ',
    translation: 'Arjuna said: Those who worship with faith, but setting aside scriptural ordinances—what is their condition, O Krishna? Is it sattva, rajas, or tamas?',
    commentary: `Arjuna asks about a common situation: people who have faith (śraddhayānvitāḥ) but ignore scripture (śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya). What guna characterizes them? Where do they stand?

This question is relevant for those outside traditional frameworks—people of genuine sincerity who don't follow prescribed paths. Are they automatically lost? Or does their faith count for something?

Krishna's answer will nuance the picture. Faith itself varies by guna. The quality of faith matters more than adherence to form. This opens space for sincere seekers who don't fit traditional categories.`

    sanskrit: 'श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nत्रिविधा भवति श्रद्धा देहिनां सा स्वभावजा |\nसात्त्विकी राजसी चैव तामसी चेति तां शृणु ||',
    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\ntri-vidhā bhavati śraddhā dehināṁ sā svabhāva-jā\nsāttvikī rājasī caiva tāmasī ceti tāṁ śṛṇu',
    translation: 'The Lord said: The faith of embodied beings is of three kinds, born of their nature—sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Hear about it.',
    commentary: `Krishna's framework: faith (śraddhā) comes in three types corresponding to the gunas. It is "born of nature" (svabhāva-jā)—one's inherent disposition shapes what kind of faith one has.

This is psychologically insightful. People don't choose their faith type deliberately; it emerges from their nature. Understanding this helps explain why different people are drawn to different spiritual paths.

The three faiths will be elaborated: sattvic faith worships the gods; rajasic faith worships power and wealth; tamasic faith worships dark forces or material things. Each produces different results.`

    themes: ['faith', 'knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्य श्रद्धा भवति भारत |\nश्रद्धामयोऽयं पुरुषो यो यच्छ्रद्धः स एव सः ||',
    transliteration: 'sattvānurūpā sarvasya śraddhā bhavati bhārata\nśraddhā-mayo\'yaṁ puruṣo yo yac-chraddhaḥ sa eva saḥ',
    translation: 'The faith of everyone accords with their nature, O Bharata. A person is made of faith—whatever their faith, that they are.',
    commentary: `A profound statement: "A person is made of faith" (śraddhā-mayo'yaṁ puruṣaḥ). Whatever you place faith in shapes who you are. "Whatever their faith, that they are" (yo yac-chraddhaḥ sa eva saḥ).

This means faith is not peripheral but constitutive. Your deepest commitments, your ultimate concerns, your fundamental trust—these make you who you are. Change your faith, change yourself.

The implication for spiritual practice: cultivating sattvic faith transforms one into a sattvic person. The object of faith matters; worship of the noble elevates, worship of the base degrades.`

    transliteration: 'yajante sāttvikā devān yakṣa-rakṣāṁsi rājasāḥ\npretān bhūta-gaṇāṁś cānye yajante tāmasā janāḥ',
    translation: 'Sattvic people worship the gods; rajasic people worship yakshas and rakshasas; tamasic people worship ghosts and spirits.',
    commentary: `The three faiths worship different things: sattvic people worship devas (gods, divine beings); rajasic people worship yakshas and rakshasas (powerful but ambiguous beings); tamasic people worship pretas and bhutas (ghosts, spirits of the dead).

This hierarchy reflects the quality of the object worshipped. Devas represent light, order, and dharma. Yakshas and rakshasas represent power without clear moral character. Pretas and bhutas represent the dark, the chaotic, the dead.

The teaching: what you worship reveals your nature; what you worship shapes your nature. Choose worship wisely. Elevate the object of devotion, elevate yourself.`

    sanskrit: 'आयुःसत्त्वबलारोग्यसुखप्रीतिविवर्धनाः |\nरस्याः स्निग्धाः स्थिरा हृद्या आहाराः सात्त्विकप्रियाः ||',
    transliteration: 'āyuḥ-sattva-balārogya-sukha-prīti-vivardhanāḥ\nrasyāḥ snigdhāḥ sthirā hṛdyā āhārāḥ sāttvika-priyāḥ',
    translation: 'Foods that promote life, sattva, strength, health, happiness, and satisfaction—juicy, oily, substantial, and agreeable—are dear to sattvic people.',
    commentary: `Sattvic food promotes life (āyus), sattva (mental clarity), strength (bala), health (ārogya), happiness (sukha), and satisfaction (prīti). It is rasyā (juicy), snigdha (oily/smooth), sthira (substantial), hṛdya (agreeable to the heart).

This is not arbitrary prescription but observation of effects. Foods with these qualities nourish without agitating, satisfy without overstimulating. They support the calm, clear state of sattva.

Diet affects consciousness. What you eat influences how you think and feel. Sattvic food supports sattvic states; therefore, the spiritual aspirant pays attention to diet.`

    transliteration: 'kaṭv-amla-lavaṇāty-uṣṇa-tīkṣṇa-rūkṣa-vidāhinaḥ\nāhārā rājasasyeṣṭā duḥkha-śokāmaya-pradāḥ',
    translation: 'Foods that are bitter, sour, salty, very hot, pungent, dry, and burning are dear to rajasic people, causing pain, grief, and disease.',
    commentary: `Rajasic food: bitter (kaṭu), sour (amla), salty (lavaṇa), very hot (atyuṣṇa), pungent (tīkṣṇa), dry (rūkṣa), burning (vidāhin). Results: pain (duḥkha), grief (śoka), disease (āmaya).

These foods stimulate and agitate. They are often preferred for their intensity—the person seeks strong sensation. But the consequences are negative: physical and mental disturbance.

The rajasic person craves excitement in food as in life. But what stimulates also depletes. The short-term pleasure leads to long-term suffering.`

    sanskrit: 'देवद्विजगुरुप्राज्ञपूजनं शौचमार्जवम् |\nब्रह्मचर्यमहिंसा च शारीरं तप उच्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'deva-dvija-guru-prājña-pūjanaṁ śaucam ārjavam\nbrahmacaryam ahiṁsā ca śārīraṁ tapa ucyate',
    translation: 'Worship of the gods, the twice-born, teachers, and the wise; purity, straightforwardness, celibacy, and non-violence—this is called austerity of the body.',
    commentary: `Bodily austerity (śārīraṁ tapaḥ) includes: worship of gods, Brahmins, teachers, and the wise (reverence); purity (śauca); straightforwardness (ārjava); celibacy (brahmacarya); non-violence (ahiṁsā).

These are external practices that discipline the body and express respect. They create the outer framework that supports inner transformation.

Notice that bodily austerity is not primarily about pain or deprivation but about reverence, purity, and harmlessness. It's about how the body is used, not how much it suffers.`

  // Austerity of speech

    sanskrit: 'अनुद्वेगकरं वाक्यं सत्यं प्रियहितं च यत् |\nस्वाध्यायाभ्यसनं चैव वाङ्मयं तप उच्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ satyaṁ priya-hitaṁ ca yat\nsvādhyāyābhyasanaṁ caiva vāṅ-mayaṁ tapa ucyate',
    translation: 'Speech that causes no disturbance, that is truthful, pleasant, and beneficial, and regular study of scripture—this is called austerity of speech.',
    commentary: `Speech austerity (vāṅ-mayaṁ tapaḥ) includes: speech that doesn't disturb (anudvega-kara), truthful (satya), pleasant (priya), beneficial (hita), and regular scripture study (svādhyāyābhyasana).

Four qualities of good speech: true, pleasant, beneficial, and non-disturbing. This is a high standard—truth alone isn't enough; it should also be pleasant and helpful. And it shouldn't unnecessarily agitate others.

Scripture study is included because it directs speech toward the sacred. What we read and recite shapes how we speak. Filling the mind with scripture elevates discourse.`

  // Austerity of mind

    transliteration: 'manaḥ-prasādaḥ saumyatvaṁ maunam ātma-vinigrahaḥ\nbhāva-saṁśuddhir ity etat tapo mānasam ucyate',
    translation: 'Serenity of mind, gentleness, silence, self-control, and purity of being—this is called austerity of mind.',
    commentary: `Mental austerity (tapo mānasam) includes: serenity (manaḥ-prasāda), gentleness (saumyatva), silence (mauna), self-control (ātma-vinigraha), and purity of being/intention (bhāva-saṁśuddhi).

This is the deepest level of austerity. External practices (body, speech) ultimately serve internal transformation. A disciplined body and speech without a disciplined mind is incomplete.

"Purity of being" (bhāva-saṁśuddhi) points to intention. Even good actions from impure motives are compromised. The goal is purity at every level—action, speech, and intention.`

    sanskrit: 'श्रद्धया परया तप्तं तपस्तत्त्रिविधं नरैः |\nअफलाकाङ्क्षिभिर्युक्तैः सात्त्विकं परिचक्षते ||',
    transliteration: 'śraddhayā parayā taptaṁ tapas tat tri-vidhaṁ naraiḥ\naphala-kāṅkṣibhir yuktaiḥ sāttvikaṁ paricakṣate',
    translation: 'This threefold austerity, practiced with supreme faith by people without desire for fruit, steadfast—that is called sattvic.',
    commentary: `What makes austerity sattvic? Supreme faith (śraddhayā parayā), no desire for fruit (aphala-kāṅkṣibhir), and steadfastness (yuktaiḥ). Same practices done with attachment become rajasic or tamasic.

"Without desire for fruit" is key. Austerity for health, reputation, or spiritual attainment is not sattvic. Austerity as offering, as expression of devotion, as discipline for its own sake—this is sattvic.

The threefold austerity (body, speech, mind) becomes sattvic when practiced with right attitude. The practice matters, but the attitude matters more.`

  // Om Tat Sat

    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['faith', 'surrender'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'ओं तत्सदिति निर्देशो ब्रह्मणस्त्रिविधः स्मृतः |\nब्राह्मणास्तेन वेदाश्च यज्ञाश्च विहिताः पुरा ||',
    transliteration: 'oṁ tat sad iti nirdeśo brahmaṇas tri-vidhaḥ smṛtaḥ\nbrāhmaṇās tena vedāś ca yajñāś ca vihitāḥ purā',
    translation: '"Om Tat Sat"—this is declared to be the threefold designation of Brahman. By it were created of old the Brahmins, the Vedas, and the sacrifices.',
    commentary: `The sacred formula "Om Tat Sat" is the triple name of Brahman. By this, Brahmins, Vedas, and sacrifices were ordained. It is the foundation of spiritual practice.

"Om" is the primordial sound, the verbal symbol of Brahman. "Tat" (That) refers to the Absolute without attributes. "Sat" (Being/Truth/Good) indicates reality and virtue.

Using this formula sanctifies action. Beginning works with "Om," dedicating them with "Tat" (to That), affirming them with "Sat" (as true/good)—this makes ordinary activity sacred.`

    sanskrit: 'सद्भावे साधुभावे च सदित्येतत्प्रयुज्यते |\nप्रशस्ते कर्मणि तथा सच्छब्दः पार्थ युज्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'sad-bhāve sādhu-bhāve ca sad ity etat prayujyate\npraśaste karmaṇi tathā sac-chabdaḥ pārtha yujyate',
    translation: 'The word "Sat" is used in the sense of reality and goodness. Also, O Partha, the word "Sat" is used for praiseworthy action.',
    commentary: `"Sat" has multiple meanings: reality (sad-bhāva), goodness (sādhu-bhāva), and praiseworthy action (praśaste karmaṇi). All three relate to what is true, valuable, and worthy.

In common usage, "sat" means good or true. A "sat-puruṣa" is a good person; "sat-karma" is good action. The word carries both ontological (reality) and ethical (goodness) weight.

Using "Sat" to bless or affirm action invokes both meanings: this action is real (not illusion) and good (not harmful). It aligns the action with truth and virtue.`

  // Without faith, action is vain
  {
    id: 'bg-17-28',

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q1'],
    themes: ['faith', 'ignorance'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'अश्रद्धया हुतं दत्तं तपस्तप्तं कृतं च यत् |\nअसदित्युच्यते पार्थ न च तत्प्रेत्य नो इह ||',
    transliteration: 'aśraddhayā hutaṁ dattaṁ tapas taptaṁ kṛtaṁ ca yat\nasad ity ucyate pārtha na ca tat pretya no iha',
    translation: 'Whatever sacrifice, charity, or austerity is performed, or whatever is done without faith, is called "asat," O Partha. It is of no value here or hereafter.',
    commentary: `The chapter concludes: action without faith (aśraddhayā) is "asat"—unreal, worthless. It benefits neither here (iha) nor hereafter (pretya). Faith is essential; without it, practices are empty.

This explains why some people practice without result. The forms may be correct, but faith is missing. Like a seed without water, the practice doesn't germinate.

The teaching completes the chapter's arc. Arjuna asked about those with faith but without scripture; Krishna answered that faith is what matters most. Even proper practice without faith is "asat"—non-being, futility.`
