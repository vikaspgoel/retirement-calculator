    sanskrit: 'एवमेतद्यथात्थ त्वमात्मानं परमेश्वर |\nद्रष्टुमिच्छामि ते रूपमैश्वरं पुरुषोत्तम ||',
    transliteration: 'evam etad yathāttha tvam ātmānaṁ parameśvara\ndraṣṭum icchāmi te rūpam aiśvaraṁ puruṣottama',
    translation: 'So it is, as You have declared Yourself, O Supreme Lord. I wish to see Your divine form, O Supreme Person.',
    commentary: `Arjuna has heard Krishna's teaching; now he wants to see. This is the movement from faith to vision, from belief to experience. He addresses Krishna as "Supreme Lord" (parameśvara) and "Supreme Person" (puruṣottama)—acknowledging what he will soon see.

The request is bold. Arjuna trusts that Krishna's form can be seen by mortal eyes and that he can bear the vision. This faith precedes the grace that makes vision possible.

This represents the devotee's natural desire to see God. Hearing is good; seeing is better. Direct experience completes what teaching begins. Krishna will honor this desire while revealing that some visions are overwhelming.`

    transliteration: 'na tu māṁ śakyase draṣṭum anenaiva sva-cakṣuṣā\ndivyaṁ dadāmi te cakṣuḥ paśya me yogam aiśvaram',
    translation: 'But you cannot see Me with your own eyes. I give you divine eyes. Behold My sovereign yoga-power.',
    commentary: `Human eyes cannot see the cosmic form—divine eyes are required. Krishna gives (dadāmi) what Arjuna cannot produce himself. The vision is possible only through grace, not through natural capacity.

"Divine eyes" (divyaṁ cakṣuḥ) suggests a transformation of perception, not just seeing but seeing differently. The same reality looks different through upgraded vision. Grace provides the capacity that nature lacks.

This has implications for spiritual seeing generally. Direct experience of the Divine requires divine assistance. Our ordinary faculties are insufficient; enhanced capacity must be granted. Hence the importance of surrender and grace.`

    transliteration: 'sañjaya uvāca\nevam uktvā tato rājan mahā-yogeśvaro hariḥ\ndarśayām āsa pārthāya paramaṁ rūpam aiśvaram',
    translation: 'Sanjaya said: Having thus spoken, O King, Hari, the great Lord of Yoga, showed to Partha His supreme divine form.',
    commentary: `Sanjaya narrates the moment of revelation. The distant seer (through Vyasa's blessing) describes what happens on the battlefield. "Great Lord of Yoga" (mahā-yogeśvara) emphasizes Krishna's mastery over the power being displayed.

The frame story reminds us: this is being told to blind Dhritarashtra. He cannot see; he must hear. Like us readers, he receives the vision through words. The cosmic form is mediated through language for those without divine eyes.

"Supreme divine form" (paramaṁ rūpam aiśvaram) indicates this is not just another form but the ultimate form—Krishna's totality made visible. What follows will attempt the impossible: describing the indescribable.`

    transliteration: 'divi sūrya-sahasrasya bhaved yugapad utthitā\nyadi bhāḥ sadṛśī sā syād bhāsas tasya mahātmanaḥ',
    translation: 'If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst forth at once in the sky, that might be like the splendor of that great Soul.',
    commentary: `The famous image: a thousand suns rising simultaneously. This approximates (sadṛśī sā syāt—"might be like") the radiance of the cosmic form. Even this comparison falls short, signaled by "might be like."

This verse was famously recalled by J. Robert Oppenheimer witnessing the first atomic blast. The power to destroy cities evoked the power to destroy worlds. Yet even nuclear light is dim compared to divine glory.

The comparison teaches through inadequacy. We cannot imagine a thousand suns, let alone something beyond that. The teaching is: give up trying to picture this; accept that it exceeds imagination. Yet the attempt orients the mind toward immensity.`

    translation: 'There, in the body of the God of gods, Arjuna then saw the whole universe resting in one place, yet divided into many.',
    commentary: `The paradox of the vision: the entire universe (jagat kṛtsnam) in one place (ekastham), yet divided into many (pravibhaktam anekadhā). Unity and diversity simultaneously visible. This is the mystery of divine reality—one and many at once.

"Body of the God of gods" (deva-devasya śarīre) locates this infinite vision in Krishna's form. The personal and cosmic are not separate; in seeing Krishna's body, Arjuna sees everything. God is not less than the universe but the universe is in God.

This vision answers the question: is God personal or impersonal? Both. In the cosmic form, the personal Krishna contains the impersonal totality. Neither aspect is complete without the other.`

    transliteration: 'tataḥ sa vismayāviṣṭo hṛṣṭa-romā dhanañjayaḥ\npraṇamya śirasā devaṁ kṛtāñjalir abhāṣata',
    translation: 'Then, filled with wonder, his hair standing on end, Dhananjaya bowed his head to the God with joined palms and spoke.',
    commentary: `Arjuna's physical response: hair standing (hṛṣṭa-romā), filled with wonder (vismayāviṣṭa). The body registers what the mind cannot process. He bows (praṇamya) with joined palms (kṛtāñjali)—the instinctive response to overwhelming presence.

"Hair standing on end" is the body's recognition of the numinous. Something beyond normal experience has been encountered; the organism responds before the mind can interpret. This is primal religious response.

Arjuna bows before speaking. Words will come, but first reverence. The proper response to the cosmic vision is worship, not analysis. Understanding follows surrender, not vice versa.`

    translation: 'Arjuna said: I see all the gods in Your body, O God, and hosts of various beings—Brahma the lord seated on the lotus, all the sages and celestial serpents.',
    commentary: `Arjuna describes what he sees: all gods (devān), all beings (bhūta-viśeṣa-saṅghān), Brahma on his lotus throne, all sages, celestial serpents. The entire hierarchy of existence is visible in Krishna's body.

Even Brahma—the creator—is contained. The one who makes universes is himself within Krishna. This establishes the priority of the Purushottama over all other divine forms, including the highest.

"I see" (paśyāmi) is repeated throughout Arjuna's description. The divine eyes are working; the vision is actual. This is not imagination or inference but direct perception of what is normally invisible.`

    translation: 'Seeing Your mouths with terrible tusks, blazing like the fires of cosmic dissolution, I know not the directions; I find no peace. Be gracious, O Lord of gods, O Abode of the universe.',
    commentary: `The vision turns terrible: mouths with tusks (daṁṣṭrā-karālāni), blazing like doomsday fires (kālānala). Arjuna loses orientation ("know not the directions"), loses peace (na labhe ca śarma). He begs for grace (prasīda).

The cosmic form includes destruction. God is not only creator and sustainer but destroyer. The same reality that gives life takes it. Arjuna sees the devouring mouths into which all beings rush to death.

"Be gracious" (prasīda) is a plea, not a demand. Arjuna has asked for this vision and now finds it overwhelming. He can't undo the seeing, but he can ask for Krishna's mercy. This is the appropriate response to divine terror—not flight but appeal.`

    translation: 'All the sons of Dhritarashtra, along with hosts of kings, Bhishma, Drona, Karna, along with our chief warriors too...',
    commentary: `Arjuna sees specific people: Dhritarashtra's sons (the enemy), Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and even his own warriors. Both sides of the battle, both enemy and friend, are entering the devouring mouths. The vision is personal now.

This transforms the battle's meaning. Arjuna's hesitation was about killing; now he sees that death is already happening, already decided. The cosmic form reveals that these warriors are already as good as dead, their fates sealed.

Including "our own warriors" (asmadīyair) shows the vision's impartiality. Death doesn't choose sides; it takes all. Arjuna's army will also perish. The battle produces losers on every side from the perspective of mortality.`

    translation: 'They rush into Your terrible mouths with fearful tusks. Some are seen caught between the teeth with crushed heads.',
    commentary: `The gruesome detail: warriors rush (tvaramāṇā viśanti) into the mouths, some caught between teeth (vilagnā daśanāntareṣu), heads crushed (cūrṇitair uttamāṅgaiḥ). This is not peaceful death but violent devouring.

The image is deliberately shocking. The God who is love is also this—the destroyer who consumes all. The cosmic form hides nothing; it shows reality entire, including aspects devotees prefer not to see.

"Rush into" suggests inevitability, not resistance. The warriors don't try to escape; they are drawn by force greater than themselves. This is the terrible grace that takes all beings at their time, ready or not.`

    translation: 'The Lord said: I am Time, the great destroyer of worlds, here engaged in destroying worlds. Even without you, all the warriors arrayed in the opposing armies shall cease to be.',
    commentary: `The famous declaration: "I am Time" (kālo'smi), the destroyer of worlds (loka-kṣaya-kṛt). The enemies will die whether Arjuna fights or not. He is instrument, not agent. The outcome is already determined.

This verse resolved Arjuna's original dilemma. He didn't want to kill; now he sees that Krishna-as-Time kills. The warriors are already dead in the cosmic sense; the battle is just the mechanism of their already-determined end.

"Even without you" (ṛte'pi tvāṁ) removes Arjuna's agency from the equation. He is not the cause of their death; Time is. He can participate or abstain, but the result is the same. His choice is about his own dharma, not their fate.`

    translation: 'Therefore arise, win glory; conquer your enemies and enjoy a prosperous kingdom. By Me alone have they already been slain. Be merely the instrument, O Savyasachin.',
    commentary: `The command: "Arise!" (uttiṣṭha). Win glory, conquer enemies, enjoy the kingdom. But know: they are "already slain by Me" (mayaivaite nihatāḥ pūrvam). Arjuna is to be merely the instrument (nimitta-mātra).

"Instrument" (nimitta) reframes agency. Arjuna is the apparent cause, not the real cause. The bow, the arm, the will that directs them—all are instruments of divine will already determined. Personal doership is illusion.

This is liberation through vision. Seeing that Time kills, Arjuna can act without guilt. His arrows deliver what Time has decreed. He takes credit for victory but not blame for death. The cosmic perspective transforms action's meaning.`

    translation: 'Having seen what was never seen before, I am thrilled; yet my mind is disturbed with fear. Show me that same (familiar) form, O God. Be gracious, O Lord of gods, O Abode of the universe.',
    commentary: `Arjuna's mixed state: thrilled (hṛṣita) at the unprecedented vision, yet disturbed (pravyathitaṁ) with fear. He asks to see the familiar form again—the four-armed Vishnu or the two-armed friend. "Be gracious" (prasīda) repeats his plea.

The human cannot long sustain the cosmic vision. What elevates also terrifies. Arjuna has seen enough; he wants his friend back. This is not spiritual failure but recognition of human limits.

"Never seen before" (adṛṣṭa-pūrvam) acknowledges the vision's uniqueness. No one in cosmic history has seen this; Arjuna alone, by Krishna's grace, received this vision. The privilege is overwhelming, literally.`

    commentary: `Krishna returns to His gentle form (saumya-vapu) and consoles (āśvāsayām āsa) the frightened Arjuna. The cosmic vision retracts; the friend reappears. The overwhelming becomes intimate again.

"His own form" (svakaṁ rūpam) indicates that the gentle form is also real, not a lesser manifestation. Both the cosmic and the gentle are Krishna's "own"—neither is more authentic than the other.

The consolation shows divine compassion. Krishna doesn't say "you should have handled that better." He comforts the frightened friend. The terror was necessary for understanding; the comfort is necessary for continuing.`

    commentary: `Krishna acknowledges the vision's rarity: "very difficult to see" (su-durdarśam). Even gods (devā) constantly long for this sight (nityaṁ darśana-kāṅkṣiṇaḥ). Arjuna received what devas cannot obtain.

This elevates Arjuna's privilege while explaining the vision's impact. If gods yearn for this, no wonder a human was overwhelmed. The comparison is not to shame but to appreciate—Arjuna has received extraordinary grace.

The "gentle form" mentioned here is the two-armed or four-armed form that Arjuna wanted to see again. Even this is rare; how much more the cosmic form? Both forms reveal Krishna, but differently.`

    commentary: `The chapter's conclusion: only through undivided devotion (bhaktyā ananyayā) can Krishna be known (jñātum), seen (draṣṭum), and entered into (praveṣṭum). Not through Vedic study, not through austerity, not through rituals—only through love.

"Known, seen, and entered" suggests progression: intellectual understanding, direct vision, and ultimate union. All three require the same key—single-minded devotion. There is no substitute.

This democratizes access while specifying the means. Anyone can love; therefore anyone can know Krishna. But the love must be "undivided" (ananya)—not shared with other ultimate concerns. This is the condition that opens all doors.`
