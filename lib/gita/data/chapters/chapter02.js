    translation: 'Sanjaya said: To him who was thus overcome with pity, whose eyes were filled with tears and troubled, who was despondent, Madhusudana spoke these words.',
    commentary: `Sanjaya paints the scene: Arjuna overcome with pity (kṛpayāviṣṭam), eyes filled with tears (aśru-pūrṇa), troubled and despondent. This is the moment before transformation—the student at their lowest point, ready to receive teaching not as information but as salvation.

From the Advaitic perspective, this description matters. Teaching enters most deeply when we have exhausted our own resources. Arjuna's tears and trouble are not obstacles to wisdom but prerequisites. The self-satisfied mind cannot receive; the broken one can.

The name "Madhusudana" (slayer of the demon Madhu) reminds us that Krishna is one who destroys delusion. What he is about to slay is not an external enemy but Arjuna's inner confusion. The real battle is about to begin—not on the field but in consciousness.`

    translation: 'The Lord said: Whence has this weakness come upon you at this critical moment? It is not befitting a noble person, it does not lead to heaven, and it brings disgrace, O Arjuna.',
    commentary: `Krishna's first words are sharp, almost shocking. He does not comfort Arjuna but confronts him. "Whence this weakness?" The word kaśmala suggests impurity, faintness, a kind of spiritual contamination. Krishna names what Arjuna is experiencing without softening it.

Shankaracharya notes that true teaching sometimes requires severity. A friend who only soothes may actually harm. Krishna cares enough to be direct: this state is "not befitting a noble person" (anārya-juṣṭam). The word ārya here means one who lives by higher values, not mere birth status.

When we are lost in emotion, we often need not sympathy but clarity. Someone who can see what we cannot see, who names our state plainly without judgment but also without false comfort. Krishna's sharp words are themselves a form of compassion.`

    transliteration: 'klaibyaṁ mā sma gamaḥ pārtha naitat tvayy upapadyate\nkṣudraṁ hṛdaya-daurbalyaṁ tyaktvottiṣṭha parantapa',
    translation: 'Do not yield to unmanliness, O son of Pritha. It does not befit you. Cast off this base weakness of heart and arise, O scorcher of foes.',
    commentary: `"Arise!" (uttiṣṭha)—the command that echoes through the Gita. Krishna calls Arjuna to stand up, not merely physically but spiritually. The "weakness of heart" (hṛdaya-daurbalya) he must cast off is not his compassion but his confusion about what compassion requires.

From the Advaitic view, this verse addresses a common spiritual danger: mistaking sentimentality for wisdom. Arjuna's paralysis feels noble to him—he thinks he is being compassionate. But Krishna sees it as weakness (kṣudram, meaning small or petty). True strength includes the ability to act when action is required.

The epithet "Parantapa" (scorcher of foes) reminds Arjuna of who he truly is. Krishna speaks to Arjuna's highest nature, not his current confusion. Sometimes we need someone to remind us that our present state is not our true identity.`

    translation: 'My being is afflicted by the taint of faint-heartedness. My mind is confused about duty. I ask you: tell me decisively what is good for me. I am your disciple. Instruct me, who have taken refuge in you.',
    commentary: `This is perhaps the most significant verse of the Gita's opening. Arjuna transforms from warrior to student. "I am your disciple" (śiṣyas te'ham)—with these words, the teaching relationship is formally established. Without this surrender, no teaching can enter.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that Arjuna diagnoses himself: "afflicted by faint-heartedness" (kārpaṇya-doṣa), "confused about dharma." This self-awareness is crucial. He does not claim to know; he admits confusion. He does not demand answers; he asks to be instructed.

"Taking refuge" (prapannam) is the pivot point. When we truly take refuge in wisdom, we are saying: my own understanding has failed; I am open to receiving what I could not discover on my own. This humility is not weakness but the prerequisite for transformation.`

    translation: 'I do not see what could dispel this grief which dries up my senses, even if I were to attain unrivaled and prosperous dominion on earth, or even sovereignty over the gods.',
    commentary: `Arjuna names his experience: grief that "dries up the senses" (ucchoṣaṇam indriyāṇām). This is depression's hallmark—the world loses its color, the senses their vitality. He cannot imagine any external achievement that would heal this inner devastation.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this admission is profound. Arjuna has realized that no worldly attainment—even ruling earth and heaven—could cure what ails him. This is not pessimism but accurate diagnosis. The problem is not in circumstances but in consciousness.

This recognition that external solutions cannot address internal suffering is where genuine spirituality begins. As long as we believe that getting something—power, wealth, relationship—will make us whole, we remain trapped. Arjuna's despair, paradoxically, shows he has outgrown that illusion.`

    translation: 'The Lord said: You grieve for those who should not be grieved for, yet you speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.',
    commentary: `Krishna's formal teaching begins with a diagnosis: Arjuna speaks wisely but acts foolishly. He knows the right words but is controlled by wrong understanding. This gap between knowledge and realization is the human predicament.

Shankaracharya explains that the wise (paṇḍitāḥ) grieve neither for those who have died (gatāsūn) nor for those still living (agatāsūn). This is not because they lack feeling but because they understand what is truly lost when a body dies—and what is not lost.

The teaching here is not that grief is wrong, but that grief based on misunderstanding is unnecessary. We grieve for what we think we are losing. But if we understood the nature of the Self, we would see that what we truly are cannot be lost. The task is not to suppress grief but to examine its basis.`

    translation: 'Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor these rulers of men. Nor will there ever be a time when all of us shall cease to be.',
    commentary: `Krishna states the fundamental truth: the Self has always existed and will always exist. "Never was there a time when I did not exist"—this is not a claim about the body but about consciousness itself. The awareness that knows experience is eternal.

From the Advaitic view, this verse points to the distinction between the empirical self (which changes and seems to be born and die) and the true Self (which is beyond time). Krishna, Arjuna, the kings—all are eternal as consciousness, though their bodies are temporary.

This is not philosophical speculation but an invitation to inquiry. What is it that has been present through all your experiences? That unchanging awareness is what Krishna points to. It was never born and cannot die. Recognizing this directly—not as a concept but as immediate knowing—is liberation.`

    translation: 'Just as the embodied Self passes through childhood, youth, and old age in this body, so too does it pass into another body. The wise person is not deluded by this.',
    commentary: `Krishna uses an analogy we can verify: the same Self that was present in your childhood is present now, though the body has completely changed. You were never the child's body; you were the awareness present in that body. Death is simply another such transition.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that we do not grieve as we pass from childhood to youth. The child's body "dies" but we do not mourn it because we know ourselves to be continuous through the change. Why then grieve at the body's final change?

The "wise person" (dhīra) is not confused (na muhyati) because they identify with what is continuous rather than with what changes. This is not denial of death but understanding of its nature. The body transforms; consciousness—what you truly are—continues.`

    translation: 'Contact with sense objects, O son of Kunti, gives rise to cold and heat, pleasure and pain. They come and go and are impermanent. Endure them, O Bharata.',
    commentary: `Krishna now addresses immediate experience: the play of pleasure and pain through the senses. Heat and cold, comfort and discomfort—these arise from contact between senses and objects. They are real experiences, but they are impermanent (anityāḥ).

From the Advaitic standpoint, the instruction "endure them" (titikṣasva) is practical wisdom. We cannot stop sensations from arising, but we can change our relationship to them. Knowing they will pass—"they come and go" (āgamāpāyinaḥ)—loosens their grip.

This is not stoic suppression but intelligent patience. When cold comes, it will pass. When pain comes, it will pass. When pleasure comes, it too will pass. This understanding does not diminish experience but frees us from being dominated by it. We can feel without being controlled by feeling.`

    translation: 'That wise person whom these do not afflict, O best among men, who is the same in pleasure and pain—that one is fit for immortality.',
    commentary: `Here is the criterion: not that pleasure and pain cease, but that they no longer "afflict" (vyathayanti). The wise person experiences both but remains "the same" (sama) in either. This equanimity is the mark of readiness for liberation.

Shankaracharya clarifies that "fit for immortality" (amṛtatvāya kalpate) does not mean earning something after death. Immortality is the recognition of what we already are—the deathless Self. One who is not thrown about by pleasant and painful experiences is prepared for this recognition.

The path is not to become unfeeling but to become stable. Feelings arise and pass through awareness like weather through the sky. The sky is not damaged by storms or improved by sunshine. To know oneself as that unchanging awareness is to be "fit for immortality"—to recognize what was never mortal.`

    translation: 'The unreal has no being; the real never ceases to be. The truth about both has been seen by the seers of essence.',
    commentary: `This verse states the metaphysical foundation of Advaita Vedanta in its most compressed form. What is truly real (sat) never ceases to exist. What is unreal (asat) has no genuine existence even when it appears. This is not philosophical theory but the direct perception of those who see truth (tattva-darśibhiḥ).

Shankaracharya's commentary on this verse is extensive. The "unreal" includes all changing phenomena—bodies, thoughts, emotions, objects. They appear, change, and disappear. The "real" is that in which all appearances arise and pass—unchanging consciousness itself.

The practical import: we suffer because we take the unreal to be real. We identify with what changes and then are disturbed when it changes. Seeing clearly that the body was never truly "me," that thoughts are not "my" permanent nature, brings freedom. The real was never threatened; only the unreal disappears.`

    translation: 'Know that to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded. No one can cause the destruction of this immutable reality.',
    commentary: `Krishna points to that which pervades everything (yena sarvam idaṁ tatam). This pervading presence is indestructible (avināśi). Nothing and no one can destroy it because it is not a thing among things but the ground of all things.

From the Advaitic view, this "immutable reality" (avyaya) is consciousness itself—not personal consciousness but the awareness in which all experience appears. It pervades the body as awareness pervades a dream. When the dream ends, awareness is not destroyed.

This teaching addresses Arjuna's fear of causing death. Krishna says: what is truly real in your teachers and kinsmen cannot be destroyed by anyone. You may destroy bodies, but you cannot destroy the Self that animates them. This is not permission to kill carelessly but clarity about what death actually is—and is not.`

    translation: 'These bodies of the embodied Self are said to have an end, while the Self is eternal, indestructible, and incomprehensible. Therefore fight, O Bharata.',
    commentary: `Krishna draws the practical conclusion: bodies end, the Self is eternal—"therefore fight." This logic may seem harsh, but it follows from the teaching. If the real cannot be destroyed and only the unreal perishes, then Arjuna's fear of "killing" is based on misunderstanding.

Shankaracharya notes that "incomprehensible" (aprameya) means the Self cannot be known as an object. You cannot see that which sees, hear that which hears. The Self is the knower, not the known. This is why it cannot be destroyed—it is not a thing that could be destroyed.

The command "therefore fight" does not glorify violence. It means: act from clarity, not confusion. Arjuna's paralysis came from false understanding. With right understanding, appropriate action becomes possible. What that action is depends on the situation; the point is to act from wisdom rather than delusion.`

    translation: 'He who thinks that this Self kills and he who thinks it is killed—both of them do not know. This Self neither kills nor is killed.',
    commentary: `Krishna strikes at the root of Arjuna's dilemma. The very categories "killer" and "killed" do not apply to the Self. Whoever thinks in these terms—whether claiming to kill or fearing being killed—misunderstands the nature of reality.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this verse deconstructs the ego's fundamental illusion of agency. "I am doing" and "this is happening to me" are both misperceptions. The Self is actionless—not because it is passive, but because it is not a limited entity that could perform or suffer actions.

This is not moral relativism that says killing does not matter. Bodies still experience pain; actions still have consequences. But the anguish of believing "I am destroying something real" is based on false identification. Clear seeing removes this anguish without removing appropriate care and responsibility.`

    translation: 'This Self is never born, nor does it ever die. Having been, it will never cease to be. Unborn, eternal, everlasting, and primeval—it is not slain when the body is slain.',
    commentary: `This verse is a jewel of the Gita, often recited at funerals in the Hindu tradition. The Self (ātman) is described with a cascade of negations: never born (ajo), never dies (na mriyate), eternal (nityaḥ), everlasting (śāśvataḥ), primeval (purāṇaḥ).

Shankaracharya explains that these are not just attributes but pointers to direct recognition. What is it that was present in your earliest memory and is present now? That awareness itself never entered time, was never born, and cannot die. Birth and death are events observed by consciousness, not events that happen to it.

For those grieving, this verse offers not abstract comfort but an invitation to inquiry. The one you have lost—what was truly them? The body that changed from infant to elder was not their essential self. That which knew all those changes continues. This is not belief but something that can be directly seen.`

    translation: 'Just as a person casts off worn-out garments and puts on others that are new, so the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and takes on other new ones.',
    commentary: `The metaphor of clothing makes the teaching accessible. You do not mourn when you discard an old shirt; you simply put on a new one. The shirt was never you. Similarly, bodies are worn, used, and eventually discarded, while the wearer remains.

From the Advaitic perspective, this analogy corrects our habitual identification. We instinctively feel that we are our bodies. But careful observation reveals that the body is more like something we have than something we are. It is instrument, vehicle, dwelling—precious, certainly, but not our identity.

This verse speaks especially to those facing death—their own or another's. The form changes; the one who inhabits form continues. This is not escapism but right relationship to the body: caring for it, using it well, and not confusing it with who we truly are. The wearer is not diminished when the garment wears out.`

    translation: 'You have a right to action alone, never to its fruits. Do not let the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.',
    commentary: `This is perhaps the most quoted verse of the Gita, the essence of Karma Yoga. We have authority over our actions (karma) but not over their results (phala). To act rightly while releasing attachment to outcomes is the path of freedom within action.

Shankaracharya explains that this is not indifference to results but liberation from the anxiety they cause. We do our best, but whether success or failure follows depends on factors beyond our control. To stake our peace on what we cannot control is to guarantee suffering.

The verse also warns against "attachment to inaction" (saṅgo akarmaṇi). Withdrawal is not the solution. The path is through engagement, not around it. We act—fully, skillfully, responsibly—but we do not cling to outcomes. This releases immense energy otherwise wasted in worry about results.`

    translation: 'Established in yoga, perform actions, having abandoned attachment, O Dhananjaya. Remain the same in success and failure; this evenness of mind is called yoga.',
    commentary: `Here Krishna defines yoga: samatva—evenness, equanimity. Not the suppression of feeling but stability that is not thrown about by success and failure. Established in this evenness, one performs action without the anxiety that attachment brings.

From the Advaitic standpoint, this evenness is our natural state when identification with outcomes ceases. We become agitated not because of circumstances but because we have staked our happiness on particular results. When that stake is withdrawn, natural equanimity reveals itself.

The instruction is to act "established in yoga" (yoga-sthaḥ)—that is, act from stability rather than seeking stability through action. We do not become peaceful by succeeding; we act peacefully regardless of success or failure. This reversal of the usual orientation is the heart of Karma Yoga.`

    translation: 'One who is established in wisdom casts off both good and bad deeds here itself. Therefore, devote yourself to yoga; yoga is skill in action.',
    commentary: `"Yoga is skill in action" (yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam)—a profound definition. The skill is not mere technical competence but the ability to act without creating bondage. The wise act without accumulating karma, whether "good" or "bad."

Shankaracharya clarifies that even good deeds (sukṛta) can bind us if performed with ego and attachment. The point is not to avoid good actions but to act without the doership that creates karmic chains. The wise act as instruments, not as initiators claiming credit.

This teaching liberates action from the burden of self-improvement. We do not perform good deeds to make ourselves better or to earn rewards. We act appropriately because that is what the situation requires, without the weight of personal agenda. This is the skill—action that is pure response, not ego-project.`

    translation: 'Arjuna said: O Keshava, what is the description of one who is of steady wisdom, who is absorbed in the Self? How does one of steady wisdom speak, how sit, how walk?',
    commentary: `Arjuna asks the practical question: what does wisdom look like in daily life? How does the enlightened person speak, sit, walk? He wants to know the marks of realization, perhaps so he can recognize it—or cultivate it.

From the Advaitic view, this question is both useful and limited. Useful because the teaching must connect to lived experience. Limited because wisdom cannot be identified by external signs alone. The same actions might come from wisdom or from performance.

Krishna's answer, which follows, describes not external behavior but internal orientation. The wise person is known not by how they walk but by how they relate to desire, to loss, to pleasure and pain. Arjuna's question shifts the teaching from metaphysics to psychology—from what is to how to be.`

    translation: 'The Lord said: When one completely casts off all desires of the mind, O Partha, and is satisfied in the Self by the Self alone, then one is called a person of steady wisdom.',
    commentary: `Krishna answers: the wise person has released all desires (kāmān sarvān) and is "satisfied in the Self by the Self alone" (ātmany evātmanā tuṣṭaḥ). This satisfaction does not depend on objects, circumstances, or other people—it is self-sufficient, drawing from the Self.

Shankaracharya emphasizes that desires (kāma) arise from a sense of lack. We want because we feel incomplete. The one established in Self-knowledge has discovered fullness at the source. From that fullness, desires may still arise as preferences, but they no longer command. The difference between wanting and needing dissolves.

This is not the extinction of personality but its freedom. The wise person may enjoy things but does not require them for peace. This "satisfaction in the Self" is not an achievement but a recognition—seeing that what we sought externally was always present within.`

    translation: 'One whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who is free from craving for pleasures, and who is beyond attachment, fear, and anger—such a person is called a sage of steady wisdom.',
    commentary: `Three freedoms define the sage: from attachment (rāga), from fear (bhaya), from anger (krodha). And two responses: not shaken by adversity (anudvigna-manāḥ), not craving pleasures (vigata-spṛhaḥ). This is equanimity in action.

From the Advaitic perspective, these are not separate attainments but aspects of a single shift in identity. When we identify with the body-mind, attachment, fear, and anger naturally arise to protect what we think we are. When identification shifts to the Self, these reactions lose their foundation.

The teaching is not to suppress these emotions but to outgrow their causes. The sage still experiences life—pleasant and unpleasant events occur—but the mind remains "not shaken." This stability is not achieved through effort but revealed when false identification is seen through.`

    translation: 'When one dwells on sense objects, attachment to them arises. From attachment springs desire, and from desire arises anger.',
    commentary: `Krishna traces the psychology of suffering: thought leads to attachment, attachment to desire, frustrated desire to anger. This chain reaction is not inevitable but it is common. Understanding the sequence allows intervention at early stages.

Shankaracharya explains that "dwelling on" (dhyāyataḥ) is the key point of intervention. The initial thought of an object is not the problem—the mind naturally encounters objects. But dwelling on it, returning to it repeatedly, cultivates attachment. From this attachment, desire inevitably grows.

This teaching is practical psychology. Notice where your mind dwells. The seeds of future suffering are being planted in present rumination. Not all thought about objects is harmful, but obsessive dwelling creates chains. The wise person does not fight desire after it has formed but addresses the dwelling-mind that creates it.`

    translation: 'From anger arises delusion; from delusion, loss of memory; from loss of memory, destruction of discrimination; and from destruction of discrimination, one perishes.',
    commentary: `The chain continues: anger creates delusion (sammoha), delusion causes loss of memory (smṛti-vibhrama), memory loss destroys discrimination (buddhi-nāśa), and without discrimination, one is lost (praṇaśyati). This is the psychology of complete downfall.

From the Advaitic view, "memory" here means remembrance of one's true nature and purpose. In anger's grip, we forget who we are, what we value, what matters. We become creatures of reaction rather than response. The intelligence that discriminates real from unreal is overwhelmed.

This verse describes what happens when the chain from verse 62 completes. The person "perishes" not necessarily physically but spiritually—they lose access to their own wisdom. We have all experienced moments when anger made us stupid. Krishna is mapping this process so we can interrupt it before the fall is complete.`

    translation: 'But one who moves among sense objects with the senses under control and free from attachment and aversion, with the self well-governed—such a person attains serenity.',
    commentary: `Here is the positive alternative. One can engage with sense objects—the world is not to be avoided—but with senses "under control" (ātma-vaśyaiḥ), free from compulsive attraction (rāga) and repulsion (dveṣa). The result is prasāda—serenity, grace, clarity.

Shankaracharya notes that this is not suppression but self-governance. The senses function; objects are encountered; but one is not dragged by attraction or pushed by aversion. This freedom comes not from avoiding the world but from a different relationship to it.

The term prasāda suggests a blessed clarity, like clear water in which everything is reflected accurately. When attachment and aversion stir the water, reflection is distorted. When they settle, we see clearly. This serenity is not achieved through withdrawal but through engaged freedom.`

    translation: 'Just as the ocean remains undisturbed though waters constantly flow into it, so too one into whom all desires enter but who remains unmoved attains peace—not one who craves desires.',
    commentary: `The ocean metaphor is perfect: rivers constantly pour into it, yet the ocean remains unchanged—full, still, established. Similarly, the wise person receives all experiences, all desires entering consciousness, yet remains unmoved. Peace comes from this stability, not from having no desires enter.

From the Advaitic view, this distinguishes two responses to desire. The "kāma-kāmī" (one who craves desires) is tossed about by every want. The wise person receives the same experiences but like the ocean receives rivers—acknowledging the input without being destabilized.

This is not a teaching about fighting desire but about being larger than desire. The ocean does not reject rivers or struggle against them; it simply has no need to struggle because of what it is. Similarly, the Self established in its own nature is not threatened by desires. They arise and pass, like weather across the sky.`

    translation: 'One who abandons all desires and moves about without craving, without sense of "mine," without ego—that one attains peace.',
    commentary: `The chapter's teaching culminates: abandon desires (kāmān vihāya), be without craving (niḥspṛhaḥ), without "mine" (nirmamaḥ), without ego (nirahaṅkāraḥ). These four freedoms yield peace (śānti). It sounds like total renunciation, but the key word is "moves about" (carati)—this person is not withdrawn but active.

Shankaracharya clarifies that these four qualities are aspects of one realization. When "I" and "mine" are seen through, craving and desire naturally fall away. They were supported by the ego structure; when that is seen to be unreal, its children dissolve.

"Moves about" is significant. This is not the peace of one who has escaped life but of one who engages life freely. The sage walks through the world, interacts, acts—but without the burden of ego-maintenance. This freedom is not after death but here, now, in the midst of living. This is the peace the Gita offers: not escape but liberation within engagement.`
