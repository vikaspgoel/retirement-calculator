    transliteration: 'śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nmayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ\nasaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu',
    translation: 'The Lord said: With mind attached to Me, O Partha, practicing yoga, taking refuge in Me—how you will know Me completely and without doubt, hear that.',
    commentary: `Krishna begins revealing His nature more fully. The prerequisites: mind attached to Him (mayy āsakta-manāḥ), practicing yoga, taking refuge in Him. With these, Arjuna will know Krishna "completely" (samagram) and "without doubt" (asaṁśayam).

This sets up the jnana-vijnana distinction. Jnana is theoretical knowledge; vijnana is realized knowledge—knowledge that transforms. Krishna promises both: complete understanding and certain realization.

The combination of attachment (āsakta) and refuge (āśraya) integrates bhakti into jnana. Knowing Krishna is not cold analysis but loving attention. The heart's devotion opens what mere intellect cannot reach.`

    transliteration: 'jñānaṁ te\'haṁ sa-vijñānam idaṁ vakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ\nyaj jñātvā neha bhūyo\'nyaj jñātavyam avaśiṣyate',
    translation: 'I shall declare to you in full this knowledge together with realization, knowing which nothing more remains to be known here.',
    commentary: `A remarkable claim: Krishna will teach knowledge (jñāna) and realization (vijñāna) so complete that nothing remains to be known. This is not arrogance but the nature of ultimate knowledge—knowing the source, all derivatives are known.

Shankaracharya distinguishes: jñāna is knowing about something; vijñāna is being established in that knowledge. Scripture gives jñāna; practice and grace bring vijñāna. Krishna promises both.

"Nothing more to be known" indicates that this knowledge is about the Ground itself. Knowing particulars, there's always more. But knowing the universal source, everything is implicitly known—as knowing gold reveals all gold ornaments.`

  // The two natures

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'भूमिरापोऽनलो वायुः खं मनो बुद्धिरेव च |\nअहङ्कार इतीयं मे भिन्ना प्रकृतिरष्टधा ||',
    transliteration: 'bhūmir āpo\'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca\nahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā',
    translation: 'Earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect, and ego—thus is My prakriti divided eightfold.',
    commentary: `Krishna's "lower nature" (aparā prakṛti): the eight elements—five gross (earth, water, fire, air, space) and three subtle (mind, intellect, ego). All material existence, including the psychological apparatus, belongs to this lower nature.

Shankaracharya notes that calling this "My prakriti" establishes Krishna as the source even of matter. The physical universe is not separate from God but His manifestation, His energy. Yet it is "lower" because it is inert, dependent, not conscious in itself.

Understanding this dissolves materialism. Matter is real but not ultimate; it derives from and depends on consciousness. The body-mind we identify with is prakriti—useful, real at its level, but not the Self.`

    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'अपरेयमितस्त्वन्यां प्रकृतिं विद्धि मे पराम् |\nजीवभूतां महाबाहो ययेदं धार्यते जगत् ||',
    transliteration: 'apareyam itas tv anyāṁ prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām\njīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat',
    translation: 'This is the lower (nature). But know My other, higher nature, O mighty-armed—the life-element by which this world is sustained.',
    commentary: `Beyond the lower, material nature is the higher nature (parā prakṛti): the jīva-bhūtā, the life-principle that animates and sustains the world. This is consciousness, the Self, the spiritual reality that makes matter meaningful.

From the Advaitic view, the parā prakṛti is the conscious dimension—not the individual soul only but consciousness itself, which appears as individual souls. Matter without consciousness is inert; consciousness without matter has no vehicle. Together, they constitute the world.

"By which this world is sustained" (yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat) indicates that consciousness is primary. Matter exists for consciousness, not vice versa. The world has meaning because it is experienced; without experiencers, what would "world" mean?`

  // All beings arise from Krishna

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',

    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'एतद्योनीनि भूतानि सर्वाणीत्युपधारय |\nअहं कृत्स्नस्य जगतः प्रभवः प्रलयस्तथा ||',
    transliteration: 'etad-yonīni bhūtāni sarvāṇīty upadhāraya\nahaṁ kṛtsnasya jagataḥ prabhavaḥ pralayas tathā',
    translation: 'Understand that all beings have these (two natures) as their source. I am the origin and dissolution of the whole universe.',
    commentary: `From these two natures—lower and higher—all beings emerge. And Krishna is the source of both: "I am the origin and dissolution of the whole universe." Everything comes from Him; everything returns to Him.

Shankaracharya sees this as establishing Krishna's ultimacy. Not just a god among gods but the source of all that is—matter and spirit, the whole jagat (moving universe). Creation, maintenance, and dissolution all trace back to Him.

This has devotional implications: worship of anything is ultimately worship of Krishna, whether the worshipper knows it or not. All paths lead home because all paths begin from home. The multiplicity of religious forms dissolves in the recognition of one source.`

    transliteration: 'mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya\nmayi sarvam idaṁ protaṁ sūtre maṇi-gaṇā iva',
    translation: 'There is nothing higher than Me, O Dhananjaya. All this is strung on Me like pearls on a thread.',
    commentary: `The supreme declaration: nothing is higher than Krishna. And the beautiful simile: all existence is strung on Him like pearls on a thread. The thread is invisible but holds everything together; remove it, and the pearls scatter.

This image captures both immanence and transcendence. The thread runs through each pearl (immanence) but is not any particular pearl (transcendence). Krishna pervades all while remaining distinct from all.

For the devotee, this is profound comfort. The apparent chaos of existence has hidden order; an invisible thread holds it all. And that thread is not impersonal force but Krishna—personal, knowing, caring. The universe is not random mechanism but divine ornament.`

  // Krishna as the essence of all

    transliteration: 'raso\'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ\npraṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu śabdaḥ khe pauruṣaṁ nṛṣu',
    translation: 'I am the taste in water, O son of Kunti, the radiance in moon and sun, the sacred syllable Om in all the Vedas, sound in space, and courage in humans.',
    commentary: `Krishna identifies Himself with the essence of various experiences: taste in water, light in luminaries, Om in scripture, sound in space, courage in people. Not the gross objects but their defining qualities are His signature.

Shankaracharya sees this as training perception. Instead of seeing water, see the taste—that's Krishna. Instead of seeing the sun, recognize the light—that's Krishna. This transforms ordinary experience into constant recognition of the Divine.

This practice is accessible to everyone. You don't need special circumstances to find Krishna; He's in the water you drink, the light you see, the courage you feel. Every moment offers contact with the Divine through its essential quality.`

  // Four types of devotees

    verse: 16,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3'],
    themes: ['faith', 'action'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'चतुर्विधा भजन्ते मां जनाः सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन |\nआर्तो जिज्ञासुरर्थार्थी ज्ञानी च भरतर्षभ ||',
    transliteration: 'catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ janāḥ sukṛtino\'rjuna\nārto jijñāsur arthārthī jñānī ca bharatarṣabha',
    translation: 'Four kinds of virtuous people worship Me, O Arjuna: the distressed, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the wise, O best of Bharatas.',
    commentary: `Four types approach Krishna: the distressed (ārta) seeking relief, the curious (jijñāsu) seeking knowledge, the ambitious (arthārthī) seeking gain, and the wise (jñānī) seeking truth. All are "virtuous" (sukṛtina)—even self-interested worship is better than no worship.

Shankaracharya notes the progression from lower to higher motivation. The distressed come for help; the curious for understanding; the ambitious for success. But the jñānī comes for Krishna Himself—not for what Krishna can provide but for who Krishna is.

This is psychologically realistic and spiritually encouraging. Most people begin worship for selfish reasons; that's fine. The relationship, once established, can mature. The distressed devotee may become curious, then ambitious, then wise. All stages are valid; growth is expected.`

    sanskrit: 'तेषां ज्ञानी नित्ययुक्त एकभक्तिर्विशिष्यते |\nप्रियो हि ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रियः ||',
    transliteration: 'teṣāṁ jñānī nitya-yukta eka-bhaktir viśiṣyate\npriyo hi jñānino\'tyartham ahaṁ sa ca mama priyaḥ',
    translation: 'Of these, the wise one, ever steadfast and devoted to One alone, is the best. For I am exceedingly dear to the wise, and they are dear to Me.',
    commentary: `Among the four types, the jñānī is supreme—ever steadfast (nitya-yukta), devoted to Krishna alone (eka-bhakti). And the relationship is mutual: "I am exceedingly dear to the wise, and they are dear to Me."

This is remarkable: Krishna declares His preference. All four types are good, but the wise devotee is best and most dear. Why? Because the jñānī loves Krishna for Himself, not for benefits. This selfless love evokes Krishna's deepest response.

"Exceedingly dear" (atyartham priya) uses superlative language of love. The relationship between jñānī and Krishna is not merely respectful but intimate, passionate, cherished. This is the crown of bhakti: knowledge that flowers into love.`

    transliteration: 'udārāḥ sarva evaite jñānī tv ātmaiva me matam\nāsthitaḥ sa hi yuktātmā mām evānuttamāṁ gatim',
    translation: 'All these are noble, but the wise I regard as My very Self. For the steadfast-minded one abides in Me alone as the supreme goal.',
    commentary: `All four types are "noble" (udārāḥ)—Krishna honors everyone who turns to Him. But the jñānī is special: "My very Self" (ātmaiva me matam). The wise one has become non-different from Krishna through complete identification.

Shankaracharya interprets "My very Self" as indicating the non-duality realized by the jñānī. The wise know that the Self in them and Krishna are not two. This knowledge dissolves the subject-object distinction that maintains separation.

"Supreme goal" (anuttamāṁ gatim) indicates there is nothing higher. The jñānī has reached the ultimate—not through transcending Krishna but through recognizing identity with Him. The goal is not beyond Krishna; Krishna is the goal.`

    transliteration: 'bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate\nvāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ',
    translation: 'At the end of many births, one possessed of knowledge surrenders to Me, (realizing) "Vasudeva is all." Such a great soul is very rare.',
    commentary: `After many lifetimes of evolution, the jñānī surrenders to Krishna with the recognition: "Vāsudeva is all" (vāsudevaḥ sarvam). This great soul (mahātmā) is extremely rare (su-durlabhaḥ).

Shankaracharya sees "many births" as indicating the long preparation required. Jnana is not cheap; it is the fruit of accumulated spiritual merit across lifetimes. When all conditions ripen, the recognition dawns: everything is Krishna.

"Vāsudeva is all" is not abstract philosophy but experiential realization. The jñānī doesn't believe this; they see it. Everywhere they look, only Krishna. Every being, every object, every event—Krishna. This vision is rare because it requires complete purification of perception.`

    transliteration: 'nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ\nmūḍho\'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam',
    translation: 'I am not manifest to all, veiled by My yoga-maya. This deluded world does not know Me, the unborn and unchanging.',
    commentary: `Why don't all recognize Krishna? Because He is veiled by yoga-māyā—His own divine power of manifestation/illusion. The deluded world (mūḍho'yaṁ lokaḥ) cannot see past the veil to the unborn (aja), unchanging (avyaya) reality.

From the Advaitic view, māyā is not a cosmic mistake but divine play. Krishna veils Himself, and this veiling creates the possibility of seeking, finding, loving. A God completely manifest would leave no room for relationship.

This explains why spiritual truth is not obvious. The world appears to be mere matter, separate selves in competition. Only when māyā's veil thins—through grace, practice, or crisis—does the underlying unity become visible. The deluded see only the veil; the wise see through it.`
