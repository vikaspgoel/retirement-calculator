    sanskrit: 'अर्जुन उवाच |\nकिं तद्ब्रह्म किमध्यात्मं किं कर्म पुरुषोत्तम |\nअधिभूतं च किं प्रोक्तमधिदैवं किमुच्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'arjuna uvāca\nkiṁ tad brahma kim adhyātmaṁ kiṁ karma puruṣottama\nadhibhūtaṁ ca kiṁ proktam adhidaivaṁ kim ucyate',
    translation: 'Arjuna said: What is Brahman? What is adhyatma? What is karma, O Purushottama? What is called adhibhuta? And what is adhidaiva?',
    commentary: `Arjuna asks fundamental questions: What is Brahman (the Absolute)? Adhyatma (the individual self)? Karma (action)? Adhibhuta (the physical realm)? Adhidaiva (the divine realm)? These terms were mentioned by Krishna; Arjuna needs clarification.

These questions arise from Krishna's teaching in Chapter 7 and prepare for the teaching on death in Chapter 8. Understanding these categories helps one navigate the dying process with knowledge rather than confusion.

The questions show Arjuna's engagement—he's not passively listening but actively processing. A good student asks questions, seeks clarity, wants to understand precisely. Krishna will answer each term in the verses that follow.`

  // What happens at death
  {
    id: 'bg-8-5',
    chapter: 8,
    verse: 5,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['surrender', 'knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'strong',
    sanskrit: 'अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम् |\nयः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ||',
    transliteration: 'anta-kāle ca mām eva smaran muktvā kalevaram\nyaḥ prayāti sa mad-bhāvaṁ yāti nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ',
    translation: 'And whoever, at the end-time, leaves the body remembering Me alone, attains My state. Of this there is no doubt.',
    commentary: `The crucial teaching on death: whoever remembers Krishna at the moment of leaving the body attains His state (mad-bhāvam). "No doubt" (nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ)—this is certain, reliable, promised.

Shankaracharya notes that "remembering" at death is not accidental but the fruit of lifelong practice. One cannot suddenly remember Krishna if the habit is not formed. Death reveals what the mind has practiced; the final thought is the ripe fruit of accumulated tendencies.

This puts life's purpose in sharp focus: prepare for death by cultivating constant remembrance. Every moment of practice strengthens the habit; every distraction weakens it. The dying moment tests what we have become.`

    verse: 6,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम् |\nतं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः ||',
    transliteration: 'yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram\ntaṁ tam evaiti kaunteya sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ',
    translation: 'Whatever state one remembers when leaving the body at death, that same state one attains, O son of Kunti, being always absorbed in that thought.',
    commentary: `The principle is generalized: whatever one remembers at death, that one becomes. Not only Krishna-remembrance but any remembrance—the last thought shapes the next life. "Being always absorbed" (sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ) clarifies: the deathbed thought reflects life's preoccupation.

From the karmic perspective, this makes sense. The mind at death continues; the body falls away. Where the mind is directed determines where consciousness goes. If habitually oriented toward the Divine, it goes to the Divine; if toward worldly concerns, it returns to the world.

This is both warning and instruction. Warning: scattered, worldly minds get scattered, worldly results. Instruction: cultivate the thought you want to die with. Practice now what you want to be then. Life is preparation for death's exam.`

  // Practice remembrance always
  {
    id: 'bg-8-7',
    chapter: 8,
    verse: 7,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q3'],
    themes: ['action', 'faith'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च |\nमय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयम् ||',
    transliteration: 'tasmāt sarveṣu kāleṣu mām anusmara yudhya ca\nmayy arpita-mano-buddhir mām evaiṣyasy asaṁśayam',
    translation: 'Therefore, at all times remember Me and fight. With mind and intellect fixed on Me, you will surely come to Me. There is no doubt.',
    commentary: `The practical instruction: "remember Me at all times" (sarveṣu kāleṣu mām anusmara) and "fight" (yudhya). Arjuna is not asked to withdraw but to engage while remembering. Mind and intellect offered to Krishna guarantee attainment.

Shankaracharya emphasizes "and fight"—worldly duties continue. This is not escapist mysticism but engaged spirituality. Remember Krishna while doing whatever your dharma requires. The remembrance sanctifies the action; the action doesn't obstruct the remembrance.

This resolves the apparent conflict between contemplation and action. You don't choose between meditating and living; you live meditatively. Every action becomes an opportunity for remembrance, every moment a chance to practice for death.`

  // The Om meditation

    verse: 13,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['surrender', 'peace'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म व्याहरन्मामनुस्मरन् |\nयः प्रयाति त्यजन्देहं स याति परमां गतिम् ||',
    transliteration: 'om ity ekākṣaraṁ brahma vyāharan mām anusmaran\nyaḥ prayāti tyajan dehaṁ sa yāti paramāṁ gatim',
    translation: 'Uttering "Om," the single syllable that is Brahman, remembering Me, one who departs leaving the body—that one attains the supreme goal.',
    commentary: `A specific practice: at death, utter Om while remembering Krishna. Om is "the single syllable Brahman" (ekākṣaraṁ brahma)—the verbal symbol of the absolute. Combined with remembrance of Krishna, it leads to the supreme goal (paramāṁ gatim).

From the yogic tradition, Om is the primordial sound from which all manifestation emerged. Returning to Om is returning to source. The dying person who can gather attention into this single point transcends the dispersion that ordinary death involves.

This gives a practical method for the deathbed. Even if one cannot think complex thoughts, Om can be uttered or held in mind. Combined with love for Krishna, it becomes the vehicle for conscious transition.`

  // Constant practice guarantees attainment

    verse: 14,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['faith', 'surrender'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'अनन्यचेताः सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यशः |\nतस्याहं सुलभः पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिनः ||',
    transliteration: 'ananya-cetāḥ satataṁ yo māṁ smarati nityaśaḥ\ntasyāhaṁ sulabhaḥ pārtha nitya-yuktasya yoginaḥ',
    translation: 'For one who remembers Me constantly, with mind on nothing else, I am easy to attain, O Partha, for the ever-steadfast yogi.',
    commentary: `The beautiful promise: Krishna becomes "easy to attain" (sulabha) for the constant rememberer. Not hard, not requiring superhuman effort—easy. The condition is ananya-cetāḥ (mind on nothing else) and constant (satatam) remembrance.

Shankaracharya notes the reciprocity: the devotee's effort to remember is matched by Krishna's becoming accessible. Constant remembrance is hard, but the goal responds by becoming easy. The more you seek, the more findable He becomes.

"Easy to attain" challenges the assumption that spiritual attainment is difficult. It is difficult if approached sporadically or half-heartedly. But for the nitya-yukta (ever-steadfast) yogi, Krishna is near, responsive, available. Difficulty is not in Him but in our inconsistency.`

  // No return for those who reach the Supreme
  {
    id: 'bg-8-15',
    chapter: 8,
    verse: 15,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['peace', 'hope'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'मामुपेत्य पुनर्जन्म दुःखालयमशाश्वतम् |\nनाप्नुवन्ति महात्मानः संसिद्धिं परमां गताः ||',
    transliteration: 'mām upetya punar janma duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam\nnāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ',
    translation: 'Having attained Me, the great souls do not again take birth, which is the impermanent abode of suffering. They have reached the highest perfection.',
    commentary: `Those who reach Krishna do not return to rebirth, which is described as "impermanent" (aśāśvatam) and "abode of suffering" (duḥkhālayam). They have attained the highest perfection (saṁsiddhiṁ paramām)—there is nowhere further to go.

Shankaracharya notes the dual characterization of samsara: it is both impermanent and suffering. Even pleasures are temporary; even heavens end. Only the Supreme is stable. Reaching there ends the cycling through unstable states.

"Great souls" (mahātmānaḥ) are those who have accomplished this—not through magic but through constant remembrance described earlier. The path is open; the goal is available; the only question is whether we will practice with sufficient dedication.`

  // Even Brahma's realm is temporary
  {
    id: 'bg-8-16',
    chapter: 8,
    verse: 16,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'detachment'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोकाः पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन |\nमामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते ||',
    transliteration: 'ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar-āvartino\'rjuna\nmām upetya tu kaunteya punar-janma na vidyate',
    translation: 'All worlds up to Brahma\'s realm are subject to return, O Arjuna. But having attained Me, O son of Kunti, there is no rebirth.',
    commentary: `Even the highest heavens, up to Brahma's world (the creator's realm), are "subject to return" (punar-āvartina)—inhabitants eventually fall back into samsara. Only reaching Krishna guarantees no rebirth (punar-janma na vidyate).

This teaching prevents misplaced goals. Seeking heaven is legitimate but limited; heaven ends. The devoted might aim for Brahmaloka and eventually have to return. Only the Supreme goal is permanent. Why settle for temporary heavens when permanent liberation is available?

From the cosmic perspective, even the creator is within time, within cycles. Only that which is beyond creation—Krishna, the Purushottama—is truly beyond return. The wise aim for the permanent, not for gilded impermanence.`

  // The cosmic day and night

    verse: 17,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद्ब्रह्मणो विदुः |\nरात्रिं युगसहस्रान्तां तेऽहोरात्रविदो जनाः ||',
    transliteration: 'sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ\nrātriṁ yuga-sahasrāntāṁ te\'ho-rātra-vido janāḥ',
    translation: 'Those who know that Brahma\'s day lasts a thousand ages, and his night a thousand ages—they know day and night.',
    commentary: `Cosmic time scales: Brahma's day is a thousand yugas (approximately 4.32 billion years), and his night equally long. This puts human timescales in perspective—what seems eternal to us is a brief moment in cosmic terms.

From the Vedantic view, these vast cycles remind us that all manifested existence is temporary. Even the universe undergoes creation and dissolution, day and night, again and again. Only the unchanging reality behind the cycles is truly eternal.

This teaching induces cosmic humility. Our problems, achievements, even our civilizations are flickers in the vast duration of existence. Anchoring in the eternal rather than the temporal makes more sense given these scales.`

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'परस्तस्मात्तु भावोऽन्योऽव्यक्तोऽव्यक्तात्सनातनः |\nयः स सर्वेषु भूतेषु नश्यत्सु न विनश्यति ||',
    transliteration: 'paras tasmāt tu bhāvo\'nyo\'vyakto\'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ\nyaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu naśyatsu na vinaśyati',
    translation: 'But beyond that Unmanifest is another eternal Unmanifest, which does not perish when all beings perish.',
    commentary: `Beyond the unmanifest (avyakta) that dissolves at the end of a cosmic cycle is yet another unmanifest—eternal (sanātana), which does not perish (na vinaśyati) when all beings (sarveṣu bhūteṣu naśyatsu) perish. This is the supreme Brahman, distinct from both the manifest world and the unmanifest Prakriti.

Shankaracharya identifies this as the param puruṣa or supreme Self—unchanging, beyond creation and dissolution. When the entire cosmos dissolves, this alone remains. It is the goal of the knower.

This verse clarifies the hierarchy: manifest world < unmanifest nature < eternal Unmanifest (Brahman). Liberation is merging with that which never perishes.`

  // The two paths after death

    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self'],
    intensity: 'gentle',
    sanskrit: 'शुक्लकृष्णे गती ह्येते जगतः शाश्वते मते |\nएकया यात्यनावृत्तिमन्ययावर्तते पुनः ||',
    transliteration: 'śukla-kṛṣṇe gatī hy ete jagataḥ śāśvate mate\nekayā yāty anāvṛttim anyayāvartate punaḥ',
    translation: 'These two paths of the world, light and dark, are considered eternal. By one, one goes to non-return; by the other, one returns again.',
    commentary: `Two eternal paths exist: the "light" (śukla) path leads to non-return (anāvṛtti); the "dark" (kṛṣṇa) path leads to return. These are the paths of liberation and rebirth, available at all times in the cosmic order.

Shankaracharya explains these as the devayāna (path of the gods) and pitṛyāna (path of the ancestors). The first leads to Brahman; the second leads to rebirth. One's karma and consciousness at death determine which path one takes.

The teaching emphasizes that results are not arbitrary but lawful. The cosmos is just; what you become determines where you go. The paths are always there, always available—the question is which one your life has prepared you for.`

  // The yogi transcends all
  {
    id: 'bg-8-28',

    verse: 28,
    narrativeRole: 'KRISHNA_RESPONSE',
    quadrants: ['Q4'],
    themes: ['knowledge_of_self', 'hope'],
    intensity: 'moderate',
    sanskrit: 'वेदेषु यज्ञेषु तपःसु चैव दानेषु यत्पुण्यफलं प्रदिष्टम् |\nअत्येति तत्सर्वमिदं विदित्वा योगी परं स्थानमुपैति चाद्यम् ||',
    transliteration: 'vedeṣu yajñeṣu tapaḥsu caiva dāneṣu yat puṇya-phalaṁ pradiṣṭam\natyeti tat sarvam idaṁ viditvā yogī paraṁ sthānam upaiti cādyam',
    translation: 'Knowing this, the yogi transcends the fruit of merit promised for Vedic study, sacrifices, austerities, and charity, and reaches the supreme, primordial state.',
    commentary: `The chapter concludes by elevating yoga above ritualistic religion. The merit from Vedas, sacrifices, austerities, and charity—the yogi transcends all this (atyeti tat sarvam). Knowing the teachings of this chapter, one reaches the supreme, primordial state (paraṁ sthānam ādyam).

Shankaracharya sees this as confirming knowledge's supremacy. Rituals produce merit; merit produces heaven; heaven ends. But the yogi who knows the imperishable Brahman and practices constant remembrance transcends the whole karmic system.

This is liberation from the religious treadmill. One can perform Vedic rituals forever and still cycle through births. Or one can know the Supreme and be done. The chapter offers not another rung on the ladder but a way off the ladder entirely.`
